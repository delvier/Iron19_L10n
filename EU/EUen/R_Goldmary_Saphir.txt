MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x12\x0Cゴルドマリー\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nザフィーア\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nHello, Saphir.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nI heard you're good with fish. Is that true?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nYep. You heard right.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nBeen fishing ever since my dad first took me out\non the water. Been cooking 'em about as long.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nIf it's got gills or flippers or tentacles, I can\ncook it to your preference.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nI see. Even uncommon ingredients like squid\nor octopus are within your purview, then.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nThey sure are! I once caught this massive thing.\nA real whopper. Don't even know what it was.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nBut that didn't stop us from cutting it up and\nmaking a huge feast for the whole village.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nThat is quite a story. You must be exceptionally\nskilled.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nThat is why I must destroy you utterly.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nWhoa, hey! Why the hostility?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nI'm sorry, Saphir, but there is only room for one\nperfect chef here.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nI challenge you to a singular contest of\nculinary skill.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nYou mean, like...a cook-off?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nThat's right. We'll showcase our talents and let\nothers decide which of us is superior.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nSure, I guess this might as well happen.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nGood. I will tell you when and where as soon as\nit is decided. Be ready to cook some seafood.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nAnd look forward to being ground into dust\nand used for seasoning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x12\x0Cゴルドマリー\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nザフィーア\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nHere we are. Ready to cook some fish?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nWell...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nNot exactly.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nHey, what's wrong? I thought you were\ngonna grind me to dust.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nAshamed as I am to admit it...I wasn't able to\nget my hands on any decent fish.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nNo? That's a shame. Look what I caught─as\nrare a specimen as you'll find in these parts.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nThe competition hasn't even started, and I've\nalready lost.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nNot at all. Look, I caught one for you too.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nWhy would you do that?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nWouldn't be fair otherwise. It's a cook-off,\nnot a fishing contest.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nThat's true...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nThank you, Saphir. This is a noble gesture.\nI'm humbled by your kindness.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nBut as much as I want to win this competition,\nI can't let you outshine me in nobility either.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nSo...please take this.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nWhat have we got here?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nRare herbs. They were hard to come by, but it\nwould be poor form not to share them now.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nYou weren't kidding─these are tough to find!\nHehe, thanks, Goldmary. You're all right.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nNow, let's get cooking! May the best chef win.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nAgreed. You're going down.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x12\x0Cゴルドマリー\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nザフィーア\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nThe cook-off was a delight, Saphir. I'm... I'm\nactually proud to say we were evenly matched.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nYeah, it was great. Can't complain about a tie\nwith a skilled chef like you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nTight as the competition was, though...that\nwasn't the best part.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nThat honor goes to all the smiling faces\nwe got to feed.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nI have to agree.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nThe crowd seemed to be so worn down before\nwe got started.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nBut by the time we were finished, they were\ncompletely revitalized.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nYeah. We did a good thing.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nI have to say, Saphir, the way you handled our\ncontest truly moved me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nHow so?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nThe only reason I was able to cook at all was\nbecause you shared your catch with me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nIf not for your generosity, I would have been\na laughingstock.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nAnd even though you could have humiliated me,\nyou didn't say another word about it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nHahaha! Are you kidding? I could say the same\nthing about you, y'know.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nI don't see how.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nThose herbs of yours were a key ingredient in\nmy dish. I couldn't have made it without 'em.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nAnd you didn't say another word about that,\ndid you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nHehe!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nWhat's so funny?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nIt's just very unlike me to refrain from\nsaying something.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nNormally, I'm the sort of person who would\ntake credit for those herbs.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nBut in this situation... Well, I guess you could\nsay I was inspired by your good deed.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nThat's really touching.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nI'd love it if we could do this again.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nI don't mean as a competition. Let's just cook\nup another feast for people.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nSounds great. We should branch out from\nseafood next time too.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nI'll be in unfamiliar territory, though, so you'll\nhave to give me a few pointers.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nI'll be happy to teach you a few tricks.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cゴルドマリー\nMaybe then you'll be able to say I inspired you\nas well.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
