MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nブシュロン\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リンデン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nMy, my. What happened here to bring you to\nsuch a state?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\nOh... I, um, found a book lying around.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\nBut when I started reading it, it was so moving\nthat I...I couldn't hold back the waterworks.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nA tragedy, is it? Tell me more.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\nIt's a story of a great sage known only as "L."\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nOh? Tell me more about this "L" fellow.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\nIt starts off with L as a young boy who's at the\ntop of his class at an academy in Elusia.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\nThen, it follows him as he becomes a royal\nsoldier─even ending up as the prince's retainer.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nMm-hmm. I'm with you so far.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\nThe prince was supposed to ascend the throne,\nbut it ended up being somebody else instead.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\nThe prince left the castle in frustration. L just\nstands there stunned as he goes.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\nThat was too sad to take, so I don't know what\nhappens next.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nOh, you poor thing. Here, dry your eyes.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\nThank you, sir.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\nYou know, lots of books make me cry, but this\none hit me really hard for some reason.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\nThinking about the prince's bitterness and the\nway L felt to see him go...it's just too tragic.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nYou've got me invested now. If you keep\nreading, do tell me how it turns out.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\nSure thing, sir.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nAnd you can keep the handkerchief.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nブシュロン\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リンデン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nSo, how's that book of yours coming along?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nOh, but where are my manners? I meant to\ngive you a treat first.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\nThese are some tasty-looking pastries.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nI baked them myself. There's apple filling inside.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\nYou bake, Sir Lindon?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nOh, yes. Nothing bakes a pastry like a good\njolt of thunder magic. Go on, try one.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\nOh, don't mind if I do.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\nWow! I had no idea a little zap of lightning\ncould make such a tasty treat.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nGood, aren't they? Now, back to the subject\nof your book.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\nOh yeah. Last time, the prince L worked for\ndidn't inherit the throne, so he left the castle.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\nThen, L meets another royal soldier and finds\ncomfort with her.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\nThey get married and begin an ordinary, but\nhappy, life together.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\nThat's as far as I've got for now.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nFascinating. This story has its hooks in me.\nI was a royal soldier once myself, you know.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nI notice you don't seem to be crying\ntoday, though.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\nIt's actually pretty tough to hold it in. L's wife\ngoes through so much for his sake...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\nBut I'm embarrassed to be seen crying all the\ntime, so I'm doing my best to keep it together.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nHeh, don't hold back on my account!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nThere's nothing to be embarrassed about.\nCry as hard as you like. Let it all out!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\nAre...are you sure? Well...if you say so...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\nUWAAAAH!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nOh my, your nose is running! Here, something\nto wipe it with.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\nThanks again...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nブシュロン\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リンデン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nI baked cookies for us, Boucheron! With\nthunder, of course, as always. Now, eat up.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\nOooh, I can't wait. Hey, there's raisins in\nthese! Yum.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nRead any further in that book yet?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\nI finished it, actually.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nHave you, now? Well then, tell me everything.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\nSure... After the wedding, L's life was simple\nbut happy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\nThe couple went through hard times, but they\ndid it together, and saw their children grow up.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\nBut just when the kids were all grown and they\ncould enjoy their sunset years...L's wife passed.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\nL never got to feed his wife the last pastry he\nbaked for her...with a bolt of thunder.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nThere, there, Boucheron... I find myself crying\nas well today.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\nI realized when I got to that part...this story is\nabout you, isn't it?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nIndeed it is. "L," of course, is my first initial.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\nBut why is there a book about you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nI thought─before I join my wife in the beyond─\nI'd record my life for posterity.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nBut I was careless and lost the manuscript.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\nSo you wrote this book? Well, now I'm sorry\nI read it without permission.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nNonsense. I'm genuinely glad that you picked it\nup and read the whole tale.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\nIt was wonderfully written, for what it's worth.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nWhy don't we spend more time together? You\ncan get to know me until my last pages.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\nIt would be my pleasure.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nSplendid! I'm in such a good mood that I think\nI might bake another batch of sweets!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nBut lightning-baking takes time, so why don't\nyou tell me your story?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nブシュロン\nLet's see, where to start? I guess with the day\nmy parents met...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
