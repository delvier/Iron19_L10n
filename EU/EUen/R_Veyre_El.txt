MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08ヴェイル\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0A\x04エル\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nHello, Nel. I'd like to speak with you a moment,\nif that's all right.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nCertainly. I have been meaning to have a word\nwith you as well.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	And there is no need for apprehension. You may\nspeak freely with me anytime you like.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nThank you. I wanted to ask... Are you really\nPapa's─I mean Sombron's─daughter?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	I've been wondering ever since I heard you were\na Fell Dragon.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nI am. And there was another of his children─in\nmy world─whose name was Veyle.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	According to Mauvier, she was quite strict but\nalso very kind.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nSo there was another version of me in your\nworld. What a peculiar feeling.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nMy feeling is that I am grateful fate has given us\nthis opportunity to converse.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nMy siblings are gone... Well, all but one. I never\ndreamed I'd find another sister.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nYou consider me a sibling.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nOf course I do. You may be from another world,\nbut you're Papa's daughter, the same as me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nAnd friendship is not sufficient for you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nDo you...not want to be my sister?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nMy heart is gladdened to hear your words, but\nmy mind is not prepared to accept them.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	My Sombron is not your "papa." And Rafal has\nbeen my only sibling for a long time.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nYou're right. I put this on you very suddenly,\ndidn't I?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018	I'm sorry for getting overexcited. Let's forget\nabout it for now and speak again another time.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08ヴェイル\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0A\x04エル\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nHi, Nel. I'm sorry about before. I should have\nrealized you might not see me as a sister.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	I was thinking it might help if we spent a little\ntime together. I brought us something to eat.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nA shared meal seems a fine way for us to kindle\nour friendship.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nGreat! I hope you don't mind if it's spicy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nI happen to enjoy a great deal of heat and salt\nin my food.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nOh, good! In that case, you're definitely going\nto enjoy this.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	I feel like everything's tasted better since I got\nhere. I love sitting down to eat with everyone.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nThey have been very kind to me as well, even\nthough I am a stranger from another world.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nThey're very welcoming.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	As a fellow Fell Dragon daughter, I want to do\nmy part to welcome you here as well.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nThank you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nYou said Rafal has been your only sibling for a\nlong time. Hasn't that been lonely?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nCertainly. I have felt the loss of each of my\nsiblings over the years.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	I always wished that we could have been closer.\nBut so much of our time was spent on survival.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	That meant envy and exploitation and betrayal.\nAt times, it meant violence.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nThat's horrible.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nThat is why I am truly grateful to have the\nopportunity to spend time with you in peace.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	But it is also why the thought of accepting you\nas my sibling is accompanied by caution.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	For me, that type of relationship has been\nfraught with rivalry. And with fear.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nDoes that mean you're afraid of me?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nI do not feel threatened, because we are not\nsiblings. We were never supposed to have met.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	Since we are free to define our relationship as\nwe like, I would prefer to think of us as friends.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nI see. Thank you for being honest with me about\nyour feelings, Nel.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024	I'd like to do this again sometime...if it's all right\nwith you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08ヴェイル\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0A\x04エル\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nNel? Can we talk?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nThis has the air of a serious matter.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nI've given it some more thought, and I really\nwould like us to be sisters.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nYour feelings matter to me, Veyle. But I am\nperplexed by this sentiment.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	Friendship between us seems to be insufficient\nfor you. Why?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nI'm glad that we're friends, and for a while\nI thought that might be enough.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	But when you talked about what happened with\nyour other siblings, I began to feel differently.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	Sisters don't have to betray or hurt each other.\nFamily doesn't have to be like that.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	Why can't we be the kind of sisters who spend\nour time chatting over good spicy food?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nIs that still too difficult for you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nIt is not. Contrary to expectation, the thought\nof a different sort of family is a pleasant one.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	And if siblings can truly have such a relaxed and\ntrusting relationship...perhaps I will reconsider.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nDoes that mean...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nI am uncertain. The happiness of gaining a sister\nis accompanied by the dread of losing her.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	I would fear the collapse of our familial bond.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nThere's no way I could become your enemy,\nNel. Not ever. I'll always be on your side.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	Even if this war separates us by force, the time\nwe spend together as a family...is forever.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nAs a family.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nThat's right. I'll never forget the time I spend\nwith my sister, and I'm sure you won't either.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	So if that thought brings you even a little bit of\nhappiness...please do reconsider.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nHmmm...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	Very well.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nReally? You mean it?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nI, too, possess a yearning for a familial bond\nand to care for those close to me.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026	If this is your sincere wish, and if I have the\npower to grant it...then let it be so.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027	Thank you for your kindness and your\ngenerosity...and your perseverance, sister.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nNo, thank you, Nel. Hearing you say that makes\nme happy beyond words!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nI am also glad.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030	I wonder if I should think of you as an older\nsister or a younger one.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nBeing from different worlds does make it really\nhard for us to know who was born first.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#032	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nBased on our appearances, I think I must be the\nelder of us.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#033	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nWhat? That can't be right! Look how much\nlonger my hair is!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#034	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nI do not see how the length of your hair is\nrelevant to the issue.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#035	No matter. The coming centuries will provide\nus ample time to settle the debate.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#036	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nHm-hm! That's true. I have that, and so much\nmore, to look forward to with my new sister.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
