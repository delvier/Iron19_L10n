MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ラピス\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08ロサード\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nYou know what, Rosado? You're quite cute.\nI've always thought so.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nAw, I'm so flattered! Thank you!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nThe fact that you're so consistently adorable...\nWell, I admire that. What's your secret?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nHmm... Not sure I've got one.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nI guess I just try to be my best self. I think about\nwho I am inside, and...I bring it out.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nYeah?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nSure. Appearances matter, but true beauty\nis what's inside.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nEven the most fashionable ensemble is useless\nif you don't feel it. You've gotta believe in you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nHm... So that's why I'm not cute. There's\nsomething wrong with what's inside me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nWhat? Lapis, you're gorgeous.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nNo! I'm not confident at all. Really, there's a lot\nthat I'm self-conscious about.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nLike the fact that I eat grass and shrubs, or that\nI'm so dang strong...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nI didn't catch all that, but I can tell by your\nface it's serious. This really matters to you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nWhatever it is, why don't we talk it over?\nI'll gladly lend you an ear.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nReally? How kind! I appreciate that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nAnd I appreciate you. Come find me anytime.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ラピス\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08ロサード\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nHey, Rosado. Can I ask you something? It's\nabout what we discussed the other day.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nSure, sure!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nYou said the secret to cuteness is confidence.\nWell...how did you find your confidence?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nHmm, I dunno. I think it must have come from\nhow I was raised.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nI see.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nI was born in a village near the Lake of Mystery.\nSome people call it the village of the fair folk.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nIt's a place of wonder. Beauty beyond the silly\nexpectations that come with stuff like gender.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nWow! I've never heard of such a place.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nEveryone accepts everyone there. However you\nsee and present yourself, you're beautiful.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nThat was my normal, growing up. It was a big\nshock when I left─seeing how different I was!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nBut I realized I love being different. And I want\neveryone to know being different is amazing.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nYou're saying being different...is good?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nNot just good─amazing! Your differences are\nwhat make you unique. What make you...you!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nIn a way, being apart from my home village has\nmade me even more confident in who I am.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nHuh... So your uniqueness became a source of\nconfidence. I like that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nMe too! And if it helps you at all, that makes me\neven happier.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nThanks. Everything you've said has resonated\nwith me. Let's chat again soon, all right?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nOf course! Anytime!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ラピス\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08ロサード\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nRosado, I want to thank you for sharing with me\nthe other day. The truth is...I'm different too.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nTell me all about it! I wanna know everything\nunique about you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nWell... My family is, um...poor. Very poor.\nIt's always made me feel like an outsider.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nJust being poor would be one thing. But I also\nlike wild plant life, and I'm scary strong.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nI end up kind of...fixating on my weirdnesses.\nThat makes it hard to feel confident.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nNone of this sounds bad to me! You know tons\nabout plants, you're super strong... That's great!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nWhen you put it that way, they almost do sound\nlike positives, but...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nStill hard to talk about sometimes though,\nisn't it?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nYeah.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nIf it'll help...I'll give you an embarrassing truth\nof my own. I've always admired you, Lapis.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nWait a second... You? Admired me?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nYup. Even from the time we were enemies,\nback at the Grand Crossing.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nYou were swinging that huge sword around.\nYou were so powerful. So stylish!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nI remember thinking how jealous I was. How I\ncould never do something like that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nR-really?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nReally. How did you get so strong, anyway?\nIs it all from your training?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nNo. It's because I fought off a lot of bears back\nin my hometown.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nBears! Well, I guess we can say your strength\ngoes all the way back to where you came from.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nYeah... Yeah! I guess you're right!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nThank you, Rosado. Hearing you say all that,\nI'm feeling much more confident.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nOne day I'll be able to say with pride, "I am who\nI am because of my hometown!"\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nMaybe not, uh...anytime soon. But someday.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nI think that's a wonderful goal.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nWhen the time comes, you can announce it\nwith a flourish of that huge sword!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nOf course. I'll get an even bigger sword, so you\ncan't possibly miss it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
