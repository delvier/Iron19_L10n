MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nグレゴリー\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOh no, what have I done...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	At least the books weren't damaged. I better\npick them up before anyone...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nWhat're you up to, Divine One?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOh! Hello, Gregory. I was asked to help tidy up,\nbut then...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nBut then it all came tumbling down, huh? Even\nthe Divine Dragon can't carry it all at once!\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	Here, let me help you. Many hands make for\nlight work, right?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThank you very much.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	If we work together, I think we can be done in\na few more trips.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nSo why the big clean, anyway?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	Or better question, why are you the one\ndoing it?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	I mean, isn't this something you could get one\nof your allies to do for you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI couldn't possibly ask someone to do my work\nfor me.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	I want to help out however I can. Even when\nthat means tidying up.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nHuh...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOK, the books are all properly stacked.\nHopefully they won't topple over again.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nSuch a kind soul. I just hope no one ever takes\nadvantage of...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOh, did you say something?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nUh! Nope. Nope, nope. Not a thing.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nグレゴリー\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nUgh... It was the middle of the day when we\nleft. Now it's completely dark.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	Today was quite the adventure, wasn't it?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI never would have expected that a simple\nshopping trip could become such an ordeal.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nFirst we found that lost child...then it turned out\nthey were looking for their cat...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	And then we managed to get lost in the woods\nwhen we went searching for the cat.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'm sorry... I had no idea those woods were\nso deep...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nIt didn't help that the cat was hiding on the\nother side of the forest.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	Not that I can blame it. Running and hiding is a\ngreat survival tactic.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nAt least everyone was reunited after all that. It's\nnice to have a happy ending.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	Thank you for coming with me. I know it went\na lot later than we expected.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nNo need to thank me. Though we could have\njust run away from the whole mess...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	But...it's not like I could have abandoned you\nto do it all on your own.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nDid you say something?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nHuh? Nothing. Anyway, you should probably\nhurry off to bed.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	I'm sure all your worried friends will give you\nquite the lecture in the morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHaha, perhaps I should prepare myself for it\nbefore going to sleep, then.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	Good night, Gregory. I promise to make this up\nto you another day.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nThat would be fun, but I don't want you to\nworry yourself over it. Sleep well.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	Spending all your energy helping others. Just\nlike the late Divine Dragon from my world...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	Heh... I suppose I didn't need to be on my\nguard around you, after all.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nグレゴリー\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nI need to apologize, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHuh? What for? You haven't done anything\nwrong, Gregory.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nBut I have to come clean. Up until this point...\nwell, I haven't fully trusted you.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	I just wasn't certain if you were someone I\ncould consider an ally, you know?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOh... Is that so?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nI was grateful when you invited me to this\nworld, even though I couldn't figure out why.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	You welcomed me without question. I...I didn't\nknow if I could believe someone like that.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	I was afraid of being betrayed. So I wasn't able\nto lower my guard around you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou say it as though that is in the past. Are you\nable to trust me now?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nYes. I've learned so much from fighting beside\nyou. And I know now that your heart is true.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	You're different from the Divine Dragon of my\nworld. But in many ways, very similar...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	You think of others before yourself, even though\nthat kindness often gets you into trouble.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	You strive for a better future, you're honest... I\ncan't imagine someone like that betraying us.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'd never betray you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nHonestly, I'm kind of ashamed to admit all this.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	So we can move forward, I want you to hit me\nonce. Twice. No, as many times as you want.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWhat? No, I could never hurt you. I know how\nmuch you hate pain.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	Besides, it's only natural to be hesitant when\nmeeting someone new.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nBut still...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nFine. If you can't come to terms with it, here.\nTake this.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nWha?! What was that? That wasn't a punch!\nYou just flicked my forehead.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nAnd that's all you get. Consider that your\npunishment. We'll never speak of this again.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nHaha. Actually, that's almost a nice sort of\npain. I don't mind it.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	Thanks, Divine One. From now on, my strength\nis yours─more so than ever before.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nグレゴリー\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHi, Gregory. Is something the matter?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nI'm just grateful that you've returned to\nus safely.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003	It's a little strange, but...I've been worrying\nabout you dying.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOh... It's because I put myself in danger, isn't it?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nNot really. Sorry, this may be a bit rambling,\nbut I'll try to explain.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006	When I heard that you were related to the Fell\nDragon, something just clicked.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007	I was scared of you when we first met. I thought\nthat's what this new fear was.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWere you frightened because you learned I'm\nthe Fell Dragon's child?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nNot at all. Honestly, I was relieved.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou were? Why?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nI guess it made me feel better to know that you\nweren't the same as our Divine Dragon.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012	On the one hand, the two of you being the same\nwould make you worthy of my trust.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013	But on the other hand, it'd have made me worry\nconstantly about you dying.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014	Now, though...even knowing you're different,\nI still worry about it. Why do I feel like this?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou truly fear for my safety...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nI'm embarrassed to admit that I don't really\ngrasp this "love" thing everyone talks about.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017	But if love is finding someone so important that\nyou're terrified of losing them, then maybe...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018	I... I want to be by your side, protecting you.\nNow and always.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019	And so, I was wondering... Wondering if I could,\nperhaps, become the Divine Dragon's partner.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nI mean, if that sounds terrible, just say so.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHm-hm!\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023	That's not terrible at all. I'm so happy to hear\nyou feel that way.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024	If you want this, as I do...then I'd like you to\nhave the Pact Ring.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nDivine One...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHaha, I had planned on telling you that you're\nimportant to me. But you beat me to it.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027	I want to become strong enough to put even\nyour worried heart at ease. Together.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#028	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nI look forward to growing strong together. I was\nafraid you'd turn me down, but...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#029	I'm glad I was brave and brought this up. Heh,\neven if that is out of character for me.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#030	I'll treasure this ring forever. It's proof of the\nbond we share.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#031	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nThis feeling...it's so intense that it hurts. But I\ndon't mind it. With you, nothing could hurt me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
