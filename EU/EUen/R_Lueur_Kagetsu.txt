MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06カゲツ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nDivine One! Divine One!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nSince you appear human, I am curious─what\nare the differences between dragon and human?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nLet's see... We live a bit longer than humans,\nwe're typically stronger and more agile...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou're right about appearance, though─we look\nmuch the same.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nInteresting! Is it also true that you slumbered in\nthe Somniel for one thousand years?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nWhat was it that woke you, after all that time?\nDid you tire of sleeping?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nTo be honest, I'm not sure.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nI see. And what were you doing before you\nwent to sleep?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'm sorry. I don't remember much from before\nI woke up...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nHm... A pity.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou're asking lots of questions, Kagetsu.\nWhy are you so interested in me?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nWhy should I not be? We are friends, of course!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nFriends? We've actually not spoken that much...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nTo my mind, we have been friends ever since\nwe first spoke. And I like to know my friends!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nIs it not so for you? Do you not want to be\nmy friend?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nNo, of course I do!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nGood! Then I would like to know all about you,\nso we can strengthen our bond.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nSo I should get comfortable and brace for more\nquestions. Got it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06カゲツ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nYour hair, Divine One─is your style unique, or\nis it common to all dragon fashion?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nNow that you mention it, I have no idea. I don't\nactually know much about dragons.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nIt seems they are mysteries even to themselves.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI apologize. You have so many questions, and I\nhave so few answers.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nNot at all! I am happy merely to talk with you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nIn my homeland, it is the Dragons of the East\nwho are worshipped, rather than Divine or Fell.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nThat is why I find you so very interesting.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI had no idea your people worshipped the\nDragons of the East!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'd love to know more about your homeland.\nWhat's it like?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nIt is part of the queendom of Solm, but remote.\nThere is not much contact with other regions.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nOur culture is unique and vibrant. But we are\nquite secluded.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIs that because your people want to protect\ntheir culture from outside influences?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nPerhaps, yes. But they also lock it away!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nI may not seem it, but I was born to royalty.\nI was trained always to preserve my legacy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nThat meant always being home, thinking only of\nfamily. It was sad, never to step outside of that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nBut now you fight with us for a cause you\nbelieve in!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'm sure your family is proud of you and the\ndifference you're making in the world.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nMaybe so.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nDid you have any other questions for me? I am\nhappy to answer.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOh, I sure do. We haven't even discussed the\nfood in your homeland yet!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06カゲツ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThank you for the chat the other day, Kagetsu.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nExactly what I was going to say! After our talk,\nI feel our bond has become unbreakable.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nTo tell the truth, however, I was rather reluctant\nto speak too much of my homeland.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWhy is that?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nYou said my family back home would be\nproud of me...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYes?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nThose were kind words, but...they were untrue.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nI abandoned my responsibility and my role.\nI left only written words to explain my leaving.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nAre there any parents who would look proudly\non their son for this? I think it is impossible.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nPerhaps they have forgotten me altogether.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOh, Kagetsu...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThat just means we have our work cut out\nfor us, doesn't it?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nHuh?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIf you accomplish great things, your family\ncan't help but be proud of you!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nSo you'll just have to become a living legend\nacross the land. Nothing to it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThey can't forget you if your name is on the lips\nof all the world. And as your friend, I'll help you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nMy friend, the Divine One...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nI had thought one meeting was enough to\nbecome friends. I now realize it is not so simple.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nTrue. Friends are much more than that. They\nhelp each other through their darkest moments.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nIf that is the case, then our bond of friendship\nhas grown incredibly strong!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou think so?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nYes! We were friends from the start, but our\nbond has grown much stronger over time.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThat's true. It certainly has.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nIndeed. And thanks to that powerful bond, word\nof our great deeds will be spread far and wide!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06カゲツ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou seem to be deep in thought, Kagetsu.\nWhat's on your mind?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nDivine One... I fear that our bond of friendship\nhas weakened.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nDid I do something wrong? I'm so sorry!\nHow can I make it up to you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nNo─it is my fault.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nI understand you now have this Pact Ring,\nwhich you will give to your cherished partner.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nI wish to be happy for this person, but however\nmuch I try to suppress it, I feel only jealousy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nYour bond with your partner will be stronger\nthan any bond of friendship.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nI cannot bear to be happy for you because I find\nmyself only wishing that were me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nKagetsu...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nThat is why I say our bond has weakened. It is\nbecause of my selfish jealousy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nKagetsu.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou're being silly.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nNo! I am being serious!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI mean it's silly for you to fret. I was already\nplanning on giving this to you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nThe Pact Ring. Why?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nBecause I want you to be my cherished partner.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nYou do? Truly?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOur bond is more powerful than any friendship.\nI would never lie to you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nOur feelings are identical? Yes! I am so happy!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nHaha! I have never had greater happiness in all\nmy life! Thank you! Thank you!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHehe! No, thank you, Kagetsu!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nFirst friends, now partners. I think this bond \nwas meant to be. What is next for us, I wonder?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nFamily, perhaps? At the very least, I'd love\nto meet yours.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nVery well. Once I am ready to return home,\nI will take you with me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nUntil then, \x0E\x06\x03\x00, I will work hard\nto make you proud of me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nAnd as your partner, I will devote my life to\nbringing you happiness. Because I love you!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
