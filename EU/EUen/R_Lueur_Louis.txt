MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0A\x04ルイ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nLouis? What are you doing there?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nOh, hello, Divine One. I wasn't doing anything\nof note, really.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nMerely observing those two over there chatting\nwith one another.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nUm, OK. And you're doing that...why?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nThat is the question, is it not?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nThere are all sorts of philosophical implications\nto the simple act of asking, "Why?"\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nTo which I suppose I would respond...\nfor edification.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nSo you watch people chat in order to\nlearn things?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nPrecisely. There is deep meaning in these\nseemingly simple encounters.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nThrough observation, many delightful and\nsubtle details reveal themselves.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nWhen one treats them as one would treat a\ngallery piece, can there possibly be any harm?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThere, uh... I think maybe there can.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWhat's right or wrong goes beyond rules and\nlaws. There's courtesy and decency.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIf you knew they didn't like being watched,\nyou'd stop, right?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nBut of course, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nI would never elevate my appreciation above\ntheir own comfort.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nJust so we're clear. Well then, I guess...I'll leave\nyou to it...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nVery good, Divine One. I trust that I have eased\nany concerns you had.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0A\x04ルイ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHi, Louis.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nAh! Greetings, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nAre you doing your people-watching thing\nagain? I can leave if I'm interrupting.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nOh, you weren't interrupting anything. I was\nthinking about my family.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nI left three younger brothers behind back in\nmy hometown.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nSo you're the oldest?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nYes, I am the oldest of us four.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWow. It must have been tough being the\nbig brother.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nI suppose so, from a certain point of view.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nOur mother passed away before her time, so it\nwas up to me to raise them.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nBut I love them nonetheless. We all muddled\nthrough together somehow.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nMaybe taking care of them is how you got to be\nsuch a good retainer.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nYou know, you may be right. It takes quite a bit\nto ruffle me, as it were.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nAnd now that I consider it...growing up in that\nway may have given rise to my little hobby.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHow so?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nSpending one's youth in an all-male household\ngives one a rather narrow view of the world.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI... I guess.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nDo your kid brothers do it too?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nThey do not.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThat kind of pokes a hole in your theory, then.\nI think it might just be you, Louis.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nHaha, the mystery deepens.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0A\x04ルイ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nThank you for your help, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nI always have such trouble deciding on gifts to\nbuy for my brothers.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIt was nothing. I'm sure they'd be thrilled to get\nany gift from their big brother.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHow's the letter going, by the way? You said\nyou were going to send one with the gifts?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nThat was my original intent, but I think\nI've reconsidered.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWhy's that?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nWell, the purpose of the letter and gifts was that\nI wasn't sure when next I shall be home.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nBut when it came time to put pen to paper,\nI found myself merely staring at the blank page.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI wouldn't worry about the best way to say it.\nJust write whatever you feel.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nSomething from the heart...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\n"How are you? I am doing well." Ugh, those are\nthe beginnings of a rather childish letter.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nNo, it's like the gift. They'll be happy to hear\nfrom you no matter what you say.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThe important thing is to make it clear. Take\nany chance you get to tell them how you feel.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nWise words...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nYou are correct, of course. Thank you. I shall\ninclude a letter after all.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nAnd so long as I'm writing to them, I shall tell\nthem all about you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nMe?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nMy brothers should know how wonderful\nyou are.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nYou won't object to me introducing a precious\nfriend to my family, will you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nAw, Louis. You're embarrassing me. But yeah,\nthat'd be nice.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0A\x04ルイ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nSorry to keep you waiting. What was it you\nwanted to talk about?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nThank you for taking the time to meet with me,\nDivine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nUm...Louis?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nWould you care for some tea?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'm fine, thanks. So you wanted to discuss\nsomething?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou're fidgeting a lot today. What's going on?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nMy apologies. I had hoped my anxieties would\nbe less obvious for all the world to see.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nI brought you here to ask a straightforward\nquestion.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nYet my hands are shaking, my face is flushed\nwith sweat, and my feet feel leaden.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIf something is bothering you, just ask, and I'll\nhelp in whatever way I can.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nIt's my brothers, you see. They strongly wish to\nmeet you once the war ends.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIs that all? Of course.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nThat's not all. It's the reason they wish to meet\nyou that has me so flustered. How to put this...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nIt would seem my brothers have discovered\njust what you mean to me, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWhat?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nThe letter I sent them contained some...effusive\npraise for you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nIn their reply, they said that they absolutely\nmust meet this person I spoke of so gushingly.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nThey even included our mother's heirloom ring\nthat I might present it to you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nSo that's it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nI apologize for putting you in this predicament.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWhat a beautiful ring. And you're giving it\nto me?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nPardon?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nYes. It would make me happy for you to have it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThank you, Louis.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#028	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou've had so much practice caring for your\nfamily that I'd feel lucky for you to care for me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#029	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThat's why I have a matching gift for you,\nif you'll take it. It's the Pact Ring.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#030	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nYou're too kind, \x0E\x06\x03\x00.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#031	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nWhen this war is over, we must visit my home\nand sample the grapes it's famous for.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#032	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'd like that. And I'd like to meet your family\nas well, of course.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#033	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nIt feels odd to step out of serving you and grow\nso close. But it's a step I'm happy I took.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
