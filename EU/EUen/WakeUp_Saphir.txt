MID_WU_C_1_IN_#001	This place is too damn quiet.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#001	Good, you're up.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#002	Guess it'd be tough to sleep through all my\nstomping around, huh?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#003	Anyway, come on. Folks are waiting.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#001	I'm no stranger to castles...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#002	but this is a whole other kind of solemn.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#003	Should have learned to mind my manners\nafter all.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#001	Good morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#002	Thought I'd greet you properly.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#003	Any conversation we have...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#004	could be our last, y'know?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#001	I wonder if it was ever someone's job to wake\nKing Morion up...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#001	Hey, get up! Time to train.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#002	Sluggish?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#003	We'll fix that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#001	Doesn't feel right to have the rank and file\nbarge into a private chamber like this.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#002	Then again, it's also a place of worship, isn't it?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#003	OK, let's get this over with. Hey, Divine One!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#001	Time to get up.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#002	The sight of you...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#003	is good for morale, y'know?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#004	Go inspire the troops to give their all.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#001	Got a live one this morning!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#001	Got your attention, huh?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#002	Prince Diamant caught this.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#003	The Somniel's got some huge fish!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#004	We're gonna feast tonight.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#001	Ngh... Hold still!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#002	So strong! Slippery!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#003	Great, you're on the floor now! What's your\nescape plan, genius?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#004	Hey, how are you doing that?! Come back!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#001	We've got a runaway fish on the loose.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#002	How far could it get, though, right?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#003	I'll send word to the kitchen. It's only a matter\nof time.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#001	You look so gentle, even dead asleep.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#001	Morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#002	You sleep like a sculpture, you know.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#003	Haven't you ever snored? Slept crooked?\nRolled over?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#001	Straight as a sword too.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#002	I sleep more like a worm on a hookâ”€all tossing\nand turning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#003	Sometimes I wake up after rolling right off\nthe bed.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#001	You're awake.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#002	Up for some training this morning?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#003	I'd be happy to join you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#001	Taking an afternoon nap, Divine One?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#002	It's almost dinnertime.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#001	Heh, I was worried you'd be exhausted...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#002	but you shot right out of bed.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#003	Ready for some grub?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#001	You must be exhausted. I don't blame you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#002	Leading an army's tough. Always gotta be in\ntop form.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#003	I can't even fathom the pressure you must\nbe under.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#001	Don't rush.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#002	Dinner can always wait.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#003	I'll tell everyone...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#004	you'll be down when you're ready.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#001	It's time to train!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#002	C'mon, let's get that blood pumping.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#001	Good!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#002	We've got our work cut out for us.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#003	I've gotta keep getting stronger if I want to do\nmy part...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#004	and make my old friend proud.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#001	My friend...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#002	I'm grateful for the talk we had recently.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#003	I still want my revenge, but I'm in less of a rush\nfor it now. It's a load off.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#001	Hey, look who's finally up!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#002	Huh?\x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#001	C'mon, let's go!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#002	Another day, another battle!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#003	Don't worry.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#004	By the Pact Ring you gave me, I swear I'll watch\nyour back out there.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#001	Shape up, soldier! We've got work to do.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#002	Was that too harsh?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#003	Am I being too hard on you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#004	You signed up for this, picking me to be your\nsparring partner.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#005	But I'm glad you did.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#006	And I'm here to push you along every step of\nthe way.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#001	OK, let's get out there and give the next battle\nall we've got.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#002	And let's come home safe.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#003	I wanna keep training with you...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#004	until I'm too old to train at all.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#001	Training time!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#002	And if you think I'll go easy on you, think again!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#001	I can tell by your face you overslept.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#002	What? Heh, I'd never get upset over a thing\nlike that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#003	As you know...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#004	outside of battle, I've got a soft heart.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#001	Sleeping soundly as always.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#002	Snoring a bit too.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#003	Heh, I still can't believe you actually said\nyou want to protect me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#004	As much as the ring you gave me, I treasure\nthose words.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#005	If I ever lose heart in battle...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#006	it will be in those words that I find my courage.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#001	Hey.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#002	We're past training time, but...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#003	No big deal.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
