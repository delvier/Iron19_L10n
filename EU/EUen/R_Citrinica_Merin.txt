MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nシトリニカ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06メリン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nMerrin! I've been meaning to tell you─fighting\nalongside you is a thrill. You're quite...cool!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nMe? Cool? Haha, you're too kind.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nBut since you mentioned it, can you be more\nspecific? How, exactly, am I cool? Just curious.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nOh, my. Where to start?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nYou just seem so fearless out there! It's like\nwatching a brave knight in action.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nA brave knight, eh? I like the sound of that.\nAnything else?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nOh? Shall I go on?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nWell, I try my best to be, as you put it...cool. \nBut I don't always know if it's working, I guess.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nThat...is a bit unexpected.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nI wouldn't have guessed that a woman like you\nwould be concerned with others' opinions.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nOh, I am. During battle, one must maintain\nan air of cool. Revealing weakness can be fatal.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nI mean, lose your cool on the battlefield...or off\nthe battlefield...and you're asking to get hurt.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nNo matter what anyone says, appearances are\nimportant. You see?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nYes...I do see. Though it must be very difficult\nto keep that in mind on the battlefield...and off.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nI'm sorry, but I better get going. I've got to get\nback to my training.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nBut thank you for the talk, Citrinne.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nIt was nice to catch up. Best of luck with\nyour training.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06メリン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nWhoa! Will you look at that! An endangered\nBrodian red swallow! Very rare indeed.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nWait! Where are you flitting off to now, you\ngorgeous thing you? What a beautiful creature...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nIs that an Elusian albatross?! I didn't know they\nmigrated through here!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nAnd where do you think you're going?! Please,\ntake me with you!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nシトリニカ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nUm...Merrin? What are you doing?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nシトリニカ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nI─ Uh, nothing...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nWhat, uh, are you doing? Wait, were you \nwatching me just now?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nYes... I didn't mean to intrude. I couldn't help\nmyself actually.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nYour frolicking reminded me of a clown I once\nsaw perform.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nAw...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nYou don't say? I, uh, actually... I'm going to\nbe...in a play! Yes, I am. Me. Merrin.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nA play? How wonderful!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nNothing fancy. Just a small production. And you\nare exactly right. I am, in fact, playing a clown.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nAh, I called it! What an interesting role for you!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nIsn't it though? A real stretch from the calm,\ncool, everyday, cool me. I have to act. A lot.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nA real challenge, you know? You can't be this\ncool and then be a clown, without digging deep.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nWhen is your play? You must tell me so I can\nattend on opening night.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nWhat now?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nI mean, that's a good question. I wrote it down\nsomewhere. I'll have to check...in my...pockets?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nBut...I also heard a rumor it might get canceled.\nNot for sure but probably. Definitely for sure.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nOh no! Please, if it's a matter of funding, you\nmust, must, must let me help.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nNope! Not a money thing. It was...there were...\ncreative differences! Psh, actors. So difficult!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nAh, well, those things always blow over. Let me\nknow when they find a new date. I'll be there.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nI will be sure to do that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nシトリニカ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06メリン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nCitrinne, I need to talk to you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nMerrin! Hello! Have they decided on a new\nopening date for your play yet?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nIt's about that. I'm so sorry. I...lied about\nthe play.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nOh my. What do you mean?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nI love rare critters. And I spotted not one but\ntwo! I was so excited, I...I acted ridiculous.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nThen you saw me, and that lie...it just flew out\nof my mouth...like an Elusian albatross.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nAn Elusian alba─ Wait, I'm not sure I follow...\nWhy would you lie about a thing like that?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nYou told me you thought I was cool, remember?\nWell, you caught me being...a clown.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nI did NOT want you to see me like that. And I\ndidn't want to disappoint you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nAh, I think I understand.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nI'm sorry, I won't lie to you again. And I won't\nlet you see me act so disgracefully either.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nMerrin, you needn't worry about any of that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nI'm not disappointed, and I don't think you did\nanything disgraceful.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nI'm actually thankful to have caught a glimpse\nof the real you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nI don't understand.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nIt's like I discovered an entirely new, entirely\ncharming side of you!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nA charming side? What do you mean?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nI see your cool side during battle...and now I\nknow you have a cute side around animals.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nI don't know about that...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nTell me, Merrin... Have you heard of a certain\nforest in Brodia that's home to rare wildlife?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nI have. It's on the royal family's private\nproperty.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nWould you like to visit it together when this war\nis over? I could reserve a day for the two of us.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nThere's a chance we might discover a new\nspecies in there! We should bring a scholar.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nWait, slow down. Wouldn't that be expensive?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nOh, it wouldn't be any trouble─or cost! One of\nmy relatives owns the forest. They protect it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nCitrinne, are you related to the royal family?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nI am! So please, don't worry. That forest will be\na perfect, private spot to frolic among fauna.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nI want you to fully embrace that adorable,\nanimal-loving side of yourself once again.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nI don't know what to say. It...means the world\nto me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nHonestly, I can't wait! And I will find a way\nto repay you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nAll I ask is that you help me spot animals during\nour trip. You can be my personal wildlife expert!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#032	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06メリン\nHaha, personal wildlife expert. I like that title.\nAnd I can't think of anything I'd like to do more.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
