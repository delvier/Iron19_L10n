MID_WU_C_1_IN_#001	Prepare to be awakened adorably!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#001	Morning!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#002	Does the power of my cuteness have you\nbrimming with energy?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#003	I'm happy to be of service!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#001	Still hiding in bed, huh?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#002	Haha, or maybe you're embarrassed to be seen\nall disheveled.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#003	It's OK. I'm a complete mess first thing in the\nmorning too.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#001	Rise and shine!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#002	Whoa, what?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#003	You don't look disheveled at all!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#004	You just roll out of bed perfect?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#005	I need to reevaluate my life...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#006	I'm gonna go.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#001	This room kinda makes me nervous...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#001	Ah! You're awake! Uh...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#002	Would you rather I not come in?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#003	Sorry, I'll go.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#001	I don't know if this is OK.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#002	My whole country worships the Fell Dragon.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#003	I wonder what Father would say if he saw me\nin this place.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#004	And Ivy too...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#001	Morning, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#002	What? I look gloomy?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#003	At least use a classy word─like "melancholy."\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#004	You're right, though. I've had a lot on my\nmind recently.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#005	But don't worry. I'll still be there when you\nneed me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#001	Elusia's most charming princess is here to\nwake you!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#001	OK, this is gonna be tough.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#002	Wait, you're already up?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#003	I was ready for you to put up a real struggle!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#004	Well, whatever. Good morning!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#001	Wow. You're a heavy sleeper.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#002	You don't snore at all either. Amazing.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#003	Hang on... You're still breathing, right?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#004	Uh, Divine One? Hey, are you alive?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#001	Phew! You're awake.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#002	I'm so relieved.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#003	Don't worry me like that!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#004	You need to take up snoring!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#005	You know, for my sake!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#001	Right, time to practice being kind. Here we go.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#001	I usually barge in here...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#002	but today I'll be more gentle.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#003	Aw, you're already awake?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#004	How am I supposed to be considerate now?\nYou ruined it!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#001	You always work so hard for the rest of us,\nDivine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#002	It's good to see you getting some rest.\nYou've earned it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#003	Look at me─coming in to wake you and\nthen telling you to sleep...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#001	Ah, you're up. Feeling rested?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#002	I want you to know I'm grateful for your advice.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#003	I'm trying to think about other people first\ninstead of putting on a show.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#001	A charming princess is here to wake you up.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#001	You're awake already?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#002	You could've slept a bit longer, you know.\nI'm early.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#003	Sorry about that, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#001	I got up bright and early today...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#002	and I came straight to you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#003	I guess I couldn't wait to see you, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#001	Morning!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#002	You look nice today.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#003	What? I'm being especially kind?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#004	Huh. That means I'm well on my way to being\ntruly charming, doesn't it?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#001	Sorry to disturb you, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#001	Morning. What's that look all about?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#002	Glad you noticed. I'm practicing being dignified.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#003	A princess should carry herself with a regal\nbearing, after all.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#001	I know better than to barge in here noisily.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#002	That's not what my mother would do, is it?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#003	She knew that real charm is being kind to\nother people.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#001	Good morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#002	I seem extra sophisticated today?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#003	If I am, it's thanks to you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#004	I'll never forget what you taught me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#001	Your most charming friend is here to wake you!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#001	You woke up fast!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#002	I was all set to wake you gently too.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#003	Oh well. You're a better conversationalist when\nyou're conscious anyway.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#004	Good morning, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#001	Moments like this are nice.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#002	Just you and me, y'know?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#003	We're both something special.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#004	So obviously we make a good pair.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#005	But times like this remind me just how well we\ncomplement each other.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#006	I know you'll always support me, no\nmatter what.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#007	I'll do the same for you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#001	Morning, Divine One!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#002	Before you step out into the big scary world...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#003	let's hang out here for a bit.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#004	Risking our lives can wait, can't it?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#001	It's me, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#002	Your favorite princess, Hortensia!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#001	Morning! Already up, I see.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#002	I told you I'd always make time for you,\nso here I am.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#003	I don't check in on all my friends like this,\nyou know.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#004	So you don't need to feel jealous.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#001	Strange...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#002	I just remembered we were enemies when we\nfirst met.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#003	I'd almost forgotten.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#004	That time feels so far away that I don't think\nabout it much.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#005	I was such a fool back then. So naive...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#006	Not to mention totally full of myself.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#007	Thank you for guiding me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#008	I'm a much better person now because of it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#001	Ah! I didn't realize you were awake!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#002	Were you only pretending to be asleep?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#003	Hm. It's OK. I don't mind if you heard all that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#004	It's the truth.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
