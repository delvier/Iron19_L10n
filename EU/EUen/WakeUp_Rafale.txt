MID_WU_C_1_IN_#001	Indolence is unacceptable, Divine One.
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#001	You woke up easily...
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#002	all things considered.
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#003	I did not expect my voice to carry over\nyour snoring.
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#004	Hm-hm. Yes, it is that loud.
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#001	Huh, you are ridiculous.
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#002	Here I am, with the power to awaken Emblems...
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#003	and yet somehow it is a challenge to rouse you.
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#004	Come now. Get up.
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#001	Finally awake?
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#002	Honestly.
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#003	I never imagined this would be a part of my\nduties here.
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#004	If that is all, I will take my leave.
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#001	It is time to wake, Divine One.
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#001	Ah. I see you are up already.
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#002	Were you looking forward to my visit?
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#003	That is a pity, because I must be going.
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#004	Sorry to disappoint you.
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#001	...
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#002	Look at you.
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#003	How can you be so trusting?
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#004	If I were still your enemy...
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#005	you would be in grave peril right now.
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#001	Awake at last, I see.
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#002	You really ought to reconsider this arrangement.
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#003	Your next visitor could be far more treacherous\nthan me.
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#004	Has that not occurred to you?
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#001	If someone must wake you...
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#002	it might as well be me.
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#003	That being said...
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#001	So you can wake on your own, after all.
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#002	Then what is the purpose of this farce?
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#003	You could spare me the trouble.
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#001	What a bizarre arrangement.
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#002	I cannot believe you ask your allies to do this.
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#003	But if I must, I may as well enjoy it.
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#004	This ought to give you quite a fright. I will just\nprepare my dragonstone...
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#001	Sharper than expected.
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#002	If you had slept...
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#003	any longer...
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#004	You would have found yourself face to face\nwith a mighty dragon.
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#005	What a shame.
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#001	Still asleep?
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#002	What am I going to do with you?
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#001	At least you woke up quickly.
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#002	In the future, if you are going to waste\nmy time...
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#003	have an apology ready.
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#001	You know full well how many years I spent...
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#002	waiting for Nel to wake.
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#003	Now you expect me to wait for you as well?
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#004	The gall...
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#001	Finally.
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#002	You know...
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#003	no one here seems to respect my time at all.
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#004	Ah, well. After waiting for a thousand years...
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#005	I suppose this felt like the blink of an eye.
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#001	I wonder...
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#002	Have you ever considered waking up on your\nown, like the rest of us?
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#001	Good morning, I suppose.
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#002	You have overslept, but...
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#003	perhaps even you must fall prey to exhaustion\nonce in a while.
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#004	I understand.
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#001	Of course not.
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#002	I have an idea. What do you make of this?
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#003	Ahem...
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#004	We can't have you sleeping in, Divine One!
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#005	You'd better wake up soon. Everyone's waiting!
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#001	At last.
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#002	You had a nostalgic dream? I fail to see why\nI should care.
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#003	Bother someone else with your insipid visions.
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#004	Now, hurry up. Go wash your face or whatever\nit is you do.
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#001	I have arrived.
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#002	I even came by early. You may rejoice.
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#001	Why is it that when I actually want you to\nremain asleep...
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#002	you wake up quickly?
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#003	I was hoping to sneak these confections under\nyour pillow, but...
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#004	Oh, never mind.
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#001	Ha.
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#002	Since you enjoyed them so much...
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#003	I made some more confections for you.
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#004	Now all I have to do is sneak these under\nyour pillow, and...
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#005	...
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#001	Divine One!
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#002	It is early yet.
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#003	Will you be returning to sleep?
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#004	No? Very well, then.
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#005	I will just have to wait until next time...
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#001	You are fortunate indeed...
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#002	to have me around to wake you.
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#001	Good morning.
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#002	Even your sleeping habits...
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#003	have started to become endearing to me.
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#004	Perhaps I should wonder what has become of\nme to think that.
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#005	Ah... Oh well.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#001	I wonder what you are dreaming about.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#002	For my part...
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#003	even the world I come from feels like it could\nhave been a dream.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#004	I wonder...
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#005	could there be a world out there...
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#006	in which I command the invocation...
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#007	to summon you as my Emblem?
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#008	I would not prefer such a world.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#009	Because the bond we share, symbolized by\nthis Pact Ring...
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#010	it is everything to me.
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#001	You heard all that?
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#002	Well...
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#003	I will not repeat it.
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#004	So you will just have to rely on your memory...
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#005	to know how I feel about you.
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#001	I have come to wake you.
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#002	If that pleases you, then rise immediately.
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#001	That actually worked?
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#002	I suppose I owe you a more heartfelt greeting.
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#003	Very well.
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#004	Here it is.
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#005	Of all your fine qualities, your sincerity...
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#006	is what I adore most.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#001	Still asleep?
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#002	I admit, sometimes I fear...
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#003	you may one day fail to wake entirely.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#004	It has happened before, after all...
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#005	both with you and my sister.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#006	I do not know if I could stand to wait another\nthousand years. Not for you.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#007	I believe I would lose my mind.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#008	To mourn for you like that...
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#009	it would break me.
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#001	Ah...
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#002	No, it was nothing important.
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#003	I am glad to see that you are awake.
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#004	Listen...
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#005	when the end comes...
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#006	let me be the first of us to sleep eternally.
