MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ジャン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nOh, dash it all! Face it, Jean. You're lost.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nIt'll cause a fuss if I don't get back soon.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06クラン\x021\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nJean? Is everything all right?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nOh... Uh, hello, Clanne.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nWere you crying? Did something happen?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nI...I wasn't crying. I was just a bit anxious from\nlosing my way, that's all.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nOur forces are getting hurt quite a lot lately.\nI came here to forage for healing herbs.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nOh! Really? That's very helpful of you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nI found the herbs I needed, but then I got caught\nup in my work, and the next thing I know...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nYou got lost.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nWhat about you, Clanne? Why are you here?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nI'm here for herbs too. The kind I need to\nmake pickles.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nOh. So, uh...do you know the way back?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nOh, yes! I come here a lot, so I can help get\nyou back safely.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nThat would be very kind of you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nYou have to pay close attention to your\nsurroundings when going into the forest alone.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nYou're right, of course. I'll be more careful\nnext time.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nGood thing I happened to run into you, huh?\nLet's go home.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nThank you, Clanne.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06クラン\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ジャン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nSay, Clanne, do you remember how you helped\nme when I got lost gathering herbs?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nMm-hmm.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nAs luck would have it, I found a use for them\nwhen I met a wounded child near our last battle.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nTreatment was simple with the herbs\nI'd collected.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nWell, that's great news!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nI hate to think what would have become of the\npoor child if I'd stayed lost in that forest.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nYou helped them as much as I did, Clanne.\nSo, thank you for that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nOh, I didn't do much. I just gave you directions.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nBut your help then rippled outward.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nThe child was from a poor family. I don't think\na visit to the doctor was in the cards.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nIf I hadn't come along with those herbs, the\nwound might have gone septic.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nYeesh.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nI may have sniffled a bit, but I didn't really think\ngetting lost was that big a deal.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nBut when a doctor is waylaid, lives could hang\nin the balance. Every second counts.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nI really must be more careful.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nJean, I'm not saying you're wrong, but don't\nbeat yourself up too much.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nEverybody has bad days.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nBut if you ask yourself, "How did I get myself\ninto this?" you can prevent it next time.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nThough I always seem to make the same\nmistakes as a Steward of the Dragon...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nMistakes? You? I can't picture it. You always\nseem so sure of yourself.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nOh, not at all. I'm still just an apprentice.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nThere are so many people older than me here\nthat I'm glad to have someone closer to my age.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nHm...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nOh no, did I say something wrong?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nNo, no! I'm happy to hear that. I always thought\nI was a burden to people.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nSo I'm glad to hear someone is happy to have\nme around.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nI don't think it's as bad as you fear.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#028	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nYou wait and see, Clanne. I'm going to be just\nas good as you someday!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06クラン\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ジャン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nOw!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nClanne! Are you OK?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nI'm fine. I just fell and got a scrape.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nEven a minor scratch could get infected if\nleft untreated.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nShow me and I can treat it for you right here.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nAll right.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nIt's bleeding a bit. I can fix that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nYeesh, that stings!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nDon't worry, I'm finished already. That wasn't\nso bad, was it?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nHeh, thank you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nNo need for thanks. It's the least I could do to\nrepay you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nHuh? For what?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nOne thing you said to me last time stuck.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nAbout learning from your mistakes so you don't\ngo repeating them.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nThat does ring a bell.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nIt was such genuine advice. Like something\nI'd hear from my family back home.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nThanks, Jean...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nYou know I come from an island in Firene. This\nplace is nice, but it doesn't feel like home.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nBut what you said helped to change that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nHuh.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nIf you miss your family, Jean, you can think\nof me as an older brother.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nI might still slip up on occasion, and I have a\nlot of growing left to do, but...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nThere's nothing wrong with that. If I had a big\nbrother like you, there's nothing I would fear.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nHa! I'd be happy to help.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nIt's nearly dinner time. How's that scratch?\nDo you need help walking?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nIt's feeling a lot better now. Your treatment did\nthe trick.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nMaybe you should lean on me anyway. Isn't that\nwhat family is for?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
