MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x12\x0Cセレスティア\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nマデリーン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nHow are you, Madeline? Are you adjusting to\nthis world?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nI was uneasy at first, but I'll say I am feeling\nmore comfortable on and off the battlefield.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nIt makes me happy to hear that. Try not to push\nyourself too hard, all right?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	I'm concerned because, well...you often\noverdo it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nZelestia... Now that we're in this new world,\nI'd appreciate it if you stopped babying me.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	Really, there's no need to worry. I'm not\noverdoing anything.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nWell, I suppose I don't need to nag too much.\nThere are others here also watching out for you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nYes, even the people of this world, despite my\nbeing new here. I'm grateful for their hospitality.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	It hardens my determination to work on their\nbehalf and match their kindness.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nLook at you, being so ceremonious, haha.\nIt reminds me of Mauvier.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nHuh?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI'm sorry. I didn't mean to...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nIt's all right. You just caught me off guard.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	I won't deny that my speech and manners\nresemble his. He was my mentor, after all.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	After my parents' deaths, it was he who took\nme in and trained me for battle.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI was so surprised when the two of you came\nto Lythos. I thought you were his daughter.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nHmph. Brother and sister I could see, but not\nfather and daughter...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018	Oh dear, what time is it? As much as I'd love\nto continue reminiscing, I ought to go train.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019	Let's pick this up later, shall we?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nHm-hm! Well... She is growing up to become a\nfine young woman.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x12\x0Cセレスティア\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nマデリーン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI was hoping we could reminisce, Madeline.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	You and Mauvier met in your hometown, is\nthat right?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nYes. I had just lost my parents and was trying\nto protect my town from the Corrupted.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	One day, a huge horde─the biggest I'd\never seen─descended on the town.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	They surrounded us. There were fires, people\ndying in the streets... I thought I was doomed.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	Then, out of nowhere, a knight appeared.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nAnd that was Mauvier.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nSince he bore the armor and banner of the\nFell Dragon's forces, I thought him an enemy.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	But he cut down all the Corrupted around me.\nEvery last one.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	And when I looked into his eyes, I knew with\ncertainty that he was on my side.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nAnd so you were saved. Then you traveled\ntogether to where I was.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	You lost your parents, your hometown... I was\nworried by how depressed you were back then.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nYes... It's embarrassing to think on now. Even\nmy memory of going to Lythos is fuzzy.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	If not for dear Mauvier, I would've surely died\nen route. He saved my life many times.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nBut you carried on. You're so strong now...it's\nlike you're a different person.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nI have my mentors to thank, Mauvier most\nof all. He taught me many skills.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	Having taken me in, he must have felt a duty to\nteach me. We trained together often.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	And I can't even count how many times he\nprotected me from danger. Like at the temple...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI know.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nI only wish I could repay him for all the ways he\nhelped me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nYou realize you gave Mauvier something too.\nSomething immeasurable.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	He was always telling me how happy he was to\nhave found you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nHappy? He said that?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nHe really did. You can feel good knowing you\nbrought him happiness. You supported him too.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025	He watched you grow and learn with the proud,\nloving eyes of a father.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nOh... Haha. It seems we've circled back to\nthe father-daughter talk.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#027	Still, I'm honored by his words.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#028	Thank you for sharing them with me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#029	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI believe Mauvier is still watching over you,\neven now.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#030	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nIn that case, I'll have to redouble my efforts to\nbecome a knight worthy of his respect.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#031	I'm going to go train... But let's talk about\nyou next time, all right?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x12\x0Cセレスティア\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nマデリーン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nZelestia, I did all the talking last time. Now it's\nyour turn. What brought you to Lythos?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nThat is an old tale indeed, hm-hm. It happened\nlong before we met back in our world.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	Over a thousand years ago, when Queen\nLumera was still alive...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	Sombron laid waste to the Mage Dragons'\nvillage. I barely escaped with my life.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	I thought I might find refuge there, since Mage\nDragons also lived in those lands.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nWhat happened then?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI found much more than just refuge.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	Divine Dragon Lumera and her child welcomed\nme like family.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	We chatted, went on walks, and ate meals\ntogether. My wounds were able to heal there.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nYes... I know the feeling.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nThen Queen Lumera lost her life, and the young\nDivine Dragon took her place.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	I served the throne for the thousand years of\npeace thereafter.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	When Sombron showed signs of returning, the\nDivine Dragon was distraught.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nThat's a surprise. Outwardly, the Divine Dragon\nalways seemed calm, if a little aloof.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	Was it around then that Lady Nel and Lord Nil─\nI mean, Lord Rafal─came to Lythos?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nYes. At first I found it difficult to accept them.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	I even attacked them when we first met,\nintending to kill them, of course.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nYou what?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nThe Fell Dragon had taken so much from us,\nand they were his children. It was instinct.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	But the Divine Dragon accepted them with a\nsmile and said to me...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	"Please support these two going forward, no\nmatter what happens."\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nNo matter what happens...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nForeboding, isn't it? It was as if the Divine\nDragon knew something I didn't.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	Perhaps the fact that Lord Nil was lying about\nwho he was.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025	We may never know for sure.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nNo... Sadly not.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nAfter that, the Four Winds came along, and...\nWell, you know the rest.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028	So, did you like my story?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nVery much. It was fascinating... I'm glad to\nfinally know your history.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030	I see that Lythos was a place of healing and\ngrowth for you, as it was for me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nAnd we're going to continue growing here.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#032	Since we both arrived at the same time, we can\nwalk this path together.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#033	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nAbsolutely. Let us face each battle, each\nchallenge, without fear.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#034	And then, when this war is over, we can once\nagain reminisce together.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#035	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI can't wait. It's a promise we will revisit when\nthere is peace again.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
