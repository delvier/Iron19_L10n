MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nAh...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nThat was a bit better than yesterday...but still\nfar from acceptable.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ラピス\x021\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nCitrinne? What are you doing up so late?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nAh!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nOh, Lapis. You frightened me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nIf you must know, I was just...brushing up on\nmy ballroom dancing.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nHmm. You're not a very good liar. I could see\nyou using magic. Are you training in secret?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nYou found me out.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nWorking this late can't be good for your health.\nYou should really get some sleep soon.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nI appreciate your concern, Lapis, but...I can't\nlet myself rest.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nYou can't?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nIf I had your strength, I might not have to train\nmyself well into the small hours of the night.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nBut...things are different for me. I must, must,\nmust grow stronger.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nOh. Citrinne, that's...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nDon't stay up for my sake. I promise to rest as\nwell, but only after I've done enough for tonight.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nJust don't push yourself too hard, OK? G'night.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nGood night, Lapis.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ラピス\x021\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nAhh, I love packages from Mom and Dad.\nI wonder what this could possibly be...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nHaha, as if I don't already know.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nOoo, they sent some really good ones this time!\nThese look extra yummy. Mmm...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nシトリニカ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nLapis? What has you cooing and humming?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nAH! Citrinne?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nYou really scared me. Don't sneak up on people\nin the dark, making such a scary face...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nShould I have worn a mask? I doubt that would\nhave been less frightening.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nThis is just my face, Lapis. Don't be cruel.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nSorry. I didn't mean it. You just really\nstartled me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nOh, what tasty-looking yams! Did you have\nsomeone fetch these from the countryside?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nNo, I didn't. They, uh... I...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nIt looks as if your parents sent them. Does your\nfamily...own land near a potato farm?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nIt was my understanding that your parents live\nin town. Is that not the case?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nUh...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nOK. I'll tell you the truth, Citrinne. My parents\ndon't live anywhere near town.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nOh?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nMy parents─actually, my whole family─lives in\nthe countryside where these taters came from.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nIs that so? But you've always said that─\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nI lied. I shouldn't have, but I did. Please don't\ntell anyone else, OK?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nI won't. Of course I won't. But...I'm confused.\nWhy would you lie about such a thing?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nI was trying to make myself seem less...you\nknow...rural.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nI worry about that all the time. Prince Alcryst\nis royalty. You're part of his extended family.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nA bumpkin like me doesn't belong next to such\nnoble company.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nLapis! That's not true! It doesn't matter if─\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nIt matters to me. I wish my family tree was as\nimpressive as yours, but...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nThings are different for me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nOh, Lapis...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#028	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nYou and I make a perfect match.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#029	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nHuh?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#030	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nYou see your family's social standing as your\nhindrance, while I see lack of strength as mine.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#031	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nEach of us has what the other lacks.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#032	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nHuh. You're right.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#033	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nYour secret is safe with me. I'll leave you be.\nI have to begin my midnight training, after all.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#034	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nGood night, Lapis.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#035	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nG'night, Citrinne.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ラピス\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nシトリニカ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nThere you are, Citrinne! I've been waiting.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nOh? Whatever for, Lapis?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nI was hoping to join you for midnight training.\nIt's sure to be more fun with a partner, right?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nOh my! But it would be terrible of me to deprive\nyou of a full night's rest.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nPlease. I'm the terrible one. I still feel bad about\nthe last time we talked.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nBesides, I can't sleep if I know a good friend is\nworking through the night.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nLapis... You're so kind.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nI had something that I wanted to offer you as\nwell. Here, take this.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nA note? No, an address. What is this?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nThat's the mailing address for one of my\nfamily's spare manors in the heart of town.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nWe haven't lived there in quite a while, so it's\nonly staffed by grounds- and housekeepers.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nOK...but why are you giving me the address?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nIf you wish to hide your rural origins, you must\nconsider where your care packages come from.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nThink of this as your new forwarding service!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nIf your parents send their packages there, the\nstaff will swap addresses and route them here.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nWhy, your family could even use that address as\na vacation home. Or they could just move in.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nThe manor is theirs to use as they like.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nWow...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nCitrinne, thank you. I didn't realize how much\nyou cared.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nThink nothing of it. I'm just looking out for one\nof my dearest friends.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nIt's a wonderful offer, but...I can't accept it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nWhat? Why not?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nMy family isn't noble, but I'm proud of them.\nI can't ask them to hide where they're from.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nI'm still nervous about other people finding out,\nbut at least I won't have to worry around you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nOh my...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nWe are quite the pair, aren't we? Each of us has\nwhat the other lacks.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nAnd we both reach out when the other\nneeds help.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nNot a bad working relationship.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nNot bad at all.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nDo you think Prince Alcryst had this balance\nin mind when he selected us as his retainers?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nOh, I doubt it. I know you're enamored with\nhim, but Alcryst isn't that clever.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#032	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nWhat? I-I am not!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#033	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nGoodness! You're blushing. Your cheeks are as\nred as the carpets in the royal court.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#034	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nCome on, don't tease me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#035	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nBesides, those carpets aren't that red. You\nshould see the tomatoes they grow back home!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#036	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nOh? That sounds like a fun day trip. Would you\nshow me around sometime?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#037	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nSure! But don't bring any money. The farmers\nback home prefer to use a barter system.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#038	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nHow rustic! I've always wanted to try bartering.\nI could stand to part with a few necklaces...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#039	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nHeh, careful! With goods like that, you'll end up\nneeding that spare manor for tomato storage.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
