MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nHaha, hard? That was nothin'.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nWe didn't have to resolve a single quarrel, and\nthere were barely any Corrupted around.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nI only wish every day was like this.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou're so easy-going...all the time. That must be\nwhy your people love you so much.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nAs your ally, I certainly enjoy working with\nsomeone so unflappable.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nUnflappable, eh? Ooo, I think I feel a blush\ncoming on.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nBut thanks for the compliment. How about we\ngrab dinner together sometime?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nDinner?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nYeah! You, me, and some hard-hitting questions.\nLike...who is your very best friend and why?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nUm, that's pretty personal.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nYou could tell me a super-secret wish─you\nknow, one you're too embarrassed to reveal.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nNo! That's even worse.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nLook, as much as I enjoy your devil-may-care\nattitude, the banter is a bit much.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nYou'd rather I be all boring and serious? Nah.\nI wouldn't be me if I wasn't a rascal.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI suppose you're right. It is hard to imagine you\nwithout that carefree personality of yours.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIt may be your most likable trait.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nフォガート\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nWhew. Guess I should call it a day.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou know, for a self-proclaimed rascal, you sure\nseem devoted to working out.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nHuh?! How long have you been standing there?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nLong enough. I bet the Sentinels would be\ninspired if they knew how hard you trained.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nNo, they wouldn't. And you're going to keep\nyour trap shut about what you saw here today.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWhy? Training isn't something to be\nembarrassed about.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nIt's not that. I just have a reputation to\nmaintain, OK?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nEveryone thinks I'm so easy-going. I gotta make\nsure it stays that way so people stay happy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'm...not following.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nIf the Sentinels saw how hard I work to get in\nfighting shape, they'd stress over keeping up.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nWorry, fear, exhaustion─that stuff is\ncontagious, you know.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nHence the unfailing good cheer. It's on me to\nstay positive and upbeat for everyone.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWow. I guess I had you all wrong. I'm sorry.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nAs you said, I'll keep my trap shut.\x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nDivine One, what are you doing here?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nI thought you agreed to forget what you saw.\nSo, why did you come back?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'm sorry.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIt's just, you've been training so hard and in\nsecret... I thought you could use some company.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nHahaha! The Divine One worrying about me?\nHow'd I get so lucky?\x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nEh, I appreciate the gesture, but I'm kind of\na prince, so there's really not much I need.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHow about that dinner you wanted? Let's have\na meal and get to know each other better.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nYou want to have dinner? And, uh, eat it\ntogether?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI do.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nI can't say I'm not tempted. I mean, dinner with\na dragon! But...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nI can't right now. Sorry.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou're turning me down? Ouch.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nNo, no! It's just...dinner with you is like the\nultimate reward, and I haven't earned it yet.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nI want to keep that carrot dangling for a while─\ngive myself something to strive for.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI see. I just hope it lives up to your expectations.\nI'll be ready when you are.\x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_RELIANCE_S_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nYep, dinner with a dragon was everything I\nhoped it would be. Well worth the wait, for sure.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThere's so much going on, I'm just glad we\ncould make this meal together happen.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nThere is something else I wish we could\nmake happen.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThere is? Hmm, is it a super-secret wish you're\ntoo embarrassed to reveal, perhaps?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nNo, no, nothing like that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nActually, maybe it kind of is. My wish is...well...\x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_RELIANCE_S_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nThis isn't rascal talk. This is serious talk. I've\nnever worked so hard to earn a dinner!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI didn't know you felt like this. I really didn't.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nI wasn't planning to tell you. I figured I'd just\nkeep it a secret forever.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou do seem to like your secrets.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHow many secrets do you have? For all I know,\nyou've asked everyone to be your ally forever.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nNo! No way! I'm careful about who I keep close.\nYou're the only one I've ever asked.\x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_RELIANCE_S_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThat's why I want you to have this.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nThe Pact Ring? But, Divine One, this means...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIt means I can grant your super-secret wish. If\nyou want to be allies for all time, I do too.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI guess I like my secrets too, because I've been\nthinking about this for quite a while, Fogado.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nReally? I'm so honored and just plain...happy!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
