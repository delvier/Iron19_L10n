MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0A\x04エル\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHey, Nel. How are you feeling? Having any\ntrouble adjusting or anything?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nI have had no difficulty. And I feel the same as\nI felt prior to my slumber.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'm glad to hear that. All the same, I hope you'll\ncome to me if there's anything you need.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nBefore we arrived here, Rafal informed me of\nthe circumstances which allowed me to awaken.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	You had a notion of how to wake me, but you\ncould not be assured of success.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	And yet you pondered whether I would come,\nas if to take that success as given. Why?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou're right, I didn't know for sure. I guess\nI just believed it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nExplain.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI chose to have faith that we'd meet again, Nel.\nNo matter how long it took.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nI see.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	You truly are possessed of a virtuous nature,\nDivine One.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	I only hope that your gentle disposition does not\ncause you to trust others unduly. Farewell.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHm-hm! I guess I should be used to the\nlectures by now.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	Even so, it's good to see her in high spirits.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	Never change, Nel.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0A\x04エル\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nDivine One, before you retire to your chambers,\na word.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nUh-oh. What did I do this time?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nIt is so very like you not to know.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	I noticed your efforts to shield me from harm in\nthe last battle. And I am appreciative.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	In doing so, however, you sustained an injury.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nSo you noticed. I did take a hit, but it was\nnothing serious.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nEven a superficial wound can be quite painful.\nAllow me to treat it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOh, thank you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nA certain other Divine Dragon I knew was also\nnonchalant about injuries.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	And always quick with empathy. The focus was\nalways outward, on the well-being of others.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	As the irreplaceable centerpiece of this army,\nyou must be more mindful of your condition.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI get it. I'm sorry. I'll be more careful.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nIt is easy to speak the words of such an oath.\nHarder to support the words with action.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou never let up, do you?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	You know, Nel, I've been meaning to ask.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	How similar am I to the Divine Dragon you knew\nin your world?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nWhy the sudden interest?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI've actually been wondering for a while.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	When you saved my life back in your world, you\nsaid that you couldn't bear to lose me.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	Does that mean... To you, am I...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	When you look at me, are you actually seeing\nthe Divine Dragon you knew before?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nThe wound is clean. And it is healing nicely.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023	You should take this day to rest and recover.\nFarewell for now.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThanks, Nel, I will. Goodnight.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0A\x04エル\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nDivine One. I am pleased to see that you are\ntaking your rest where you can find it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI had some spare time, so I thought I'd follow\nyour advice and take it easy for a change.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	I only wish I had the luxury all the time.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nTo be so at peace that you could fall asleep at\nany moment─that is happiness.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	Many fail to appreciate it while they have it.\nAnd you work tirelessly to achieve it for others.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	That is why you have my respect.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nRespect? OK, where is Nel, and what have you\ndone with her?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nDo not be so taken aback. It is true, and it ought\nnot to be such a surprise.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	Perhaps I have hidden it better than I thought.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nMaybe a little bit.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nI believe I have an answer to the question you\nasked me previously.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	In truth, I have known the answer for some\ntime. I was merely unable to find the words.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nDon't worry. I understand.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	Now that you have an answer, though, I'd like\nto hear it.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	Do you actually think of me as the same\nDivine Dragon you knew before?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nI do not. You may have the same name and\nsimilar eyes, but you are distinct and unique.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	When I stand beside you, in or out of battle,\nI see only this \x0E\x06\x03\x00, here and now.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	It is you I wish to protect. And it will be your\nenemies I destroy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'm relieved to hear you say that. Thank you.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	That devotion goes both ways, you know.\nI want to protect you too.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	I don't want to lose you again.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nThose words are...complicated for me to hear,\nDivine One.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	Nevertheless, consider them to be engraved\nupon my heart.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	Let us fight to hold on to what has become\nso dear to the both of us.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0A\x04エル\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nDivine One. Before you proceed to battle, allow\nme to assist you with any preparations.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI appreciate that, Nel.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003	I'm actually all set, but it'd be great if you could\ncheck on the others.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nI see.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005	...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWhat's wrong?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nApologies. My offer of assistance was merely\nan excuse to be near you.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008	I am...concerned.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nTalk to me. Maybe I can help.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nNot only have I seen you endure battle after\nbattle, but now you have faced death itself.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011	This war has no doubt taken its toll upon your\nbody and mind. Tell me how you are feeling.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'm OK. Really.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013	I'm as tired as you'd expect, but it hasn't\nslowed me down too much.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014	Overall, if anything, I'm feeling stronger than\nI've ever felt before.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015	That's not just me being the thirteenth Emblem.\nIt's thanks to my friends─especially you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nIf I did not know better, I would attribute your\nremarkable strength to Divine Dragon blood.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017	Imagine my surprise when I learned that you\nwere actually born a Fell Dragon child.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018	That said, though we are not family, we share a\nheritage. And I am glad for that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'm flattered to hear you say so.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nIt is my intention to remain by your side for as\nlong as I can. Even after the fighting is done.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021	It is my wish to remain your companion and to\nbear witness to the world of peace you create.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThere's no one I'd rather have by my side for\nthat. I can't imagine my life without you, Nel.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023	That's why I've been wanting to give you this.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nDivine One, is this...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThe Pact Ring. I'd like it to be a symbol of our\nshared future. Will you accept?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIf you'd said you thought of me as the same\nperson you once knew, I wouldn't feel this way.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#028	But you said that you only see me, this version\nof me, here and now.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#029	I'll never be a substitute for the Divine Dragon\nyou used to know.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#030	But as my own person, I can love you just as\nmuch. I hope you feel the same.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#031	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nI do, Divine One. And I am deeply moved by\nyour words.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#032	Forgive me─this is not an occasion for tears.\nBut as you can see, I am smiling.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#033	And I will gladly accept this ring.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#034	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI can't tell you how happy that makes me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#035	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nNow that the pact is sealed, allow me to express\nmy feelings to you without reservation.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#036	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nMy fondness for you grows each and every\nday. I love you, \x0E\x06\x03\x00.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
