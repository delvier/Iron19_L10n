MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nミスティラ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0A\x04エル\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nThe war council is not for a while yet. I should\nfind a way to fill the time.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	The weather is warm and lovely today. Perhaps\nI should simply relax and enjoy it. Ah...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	I must have dozed off.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	Hm? What is this roasted meat doing here?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	Did someone forget to eat?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	Unplanned naps seem to have become a habit\nof mine.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	Hmm... Roasted meat sitting out upon the\nground again. Mysterious.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	Surely the owner would have noticed two\nmissing meals...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	Zzz...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nOK, she's fast asleep. Secret snack, activate!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nStop right there.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nEee!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nPrincess of Solm. You are the one who has been\nleaving roasted meat in my presence.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nWhat? Ha...haha... No.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nThen explain what you have there.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nIt's a...fashion accessory.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	Anyway, sorry to bother you, bye!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nHold a moment! I only wanted to ask...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019	No use. She is gone. How perplexing...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nミスティラ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0A\x04エル\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\n♪Sizzle and crackle on the heat! Nothin' tastes\nbetter than roasty meat, yeah!♪\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nYou are not easy to find, little princess.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nAh! Lady Nel!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nI wish to discuss the food you have been\nleaving in front of me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nGuess there's no point hiding it. Yeah, that was\nme. Lately, you just look so tired.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	Whenever I walk past you, there you are,\nsleeping on the ground.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nI figured a good strong meal would put some\npep back in your step.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nForgive me─it seems that my recent outdoor\nnaps have caused you to worry.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	The concern is appreciated, but I still do not\nunderstand what role the meat is meant to play.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nFood gives you energy, right? So more food,\nmore energy!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nPerhaps that is true for your kind. But such\nthings fail to put a...pep in my step, as you say.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	So, if that is your intention, I would recommend\nan alternative approach.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nWhoa, I didn't even think of trying something\nelse! Got any ideas? Hit me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nI rather enjoyed the song you were singing\nearlier. Perhaps you could continue that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nOoo, sure! Which one? "Facing Snackwards"?\n"Meat on the Wind"? "Bacon in My Heart"?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nI did not realize there were so many. I am\nuncertain of the title. The choice is yours.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nI can't believe you actually wanna hear me sing!\n♪My time has finally come!♪\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	Hm-hm! Y'know, I can't decide. Why don't I\njust sing 'em all for you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nI would appreciate that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nミスティラ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0A\x04エル\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nSuch melancholy is uncharacteristic of you,\nPrincess Timerra.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nOh. Hey, Lady Nel.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nPerhaps you should consider roasting up some\nmeat. After all, your step requires pep.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nYou remembered! That's so sweet. The truth is,\nI'm feeling a little down about my singing lately.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nExplain.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nSome folks passed by while I was building a fire\nearlier. They said some stuff.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	"What's that horrible sound?" "I think my ears\nare bleeding!" That kind of thing...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nInexcusable.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nOh, that's not what bugged me.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	What bothered me was wondering if you also\nthought that stuff, but were too polite to say.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	Now I'm worried you're just putting up with my\nsinging to be nice. Sorry, I'm a big dummy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nIndeed, you are a very large dummy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nWha?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nI cherish your singing with all my heart.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	Each song you sing is a special treasure that\nI will experience nowhere else.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	You must understand─we dragons live a very\nlong time. Thousands of years.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nI know.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nEven the mind of a dragon is unable to retain\nthe whole of such a lengthy interval of time.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	And so, many of our memories, beginning with\nthe least noteworthy, fade away and are lost.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	That is why, to me, a memorable song is more\nvaluable than any amount of singing skill.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	The recollection of your music will endure in my\nmind for hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nWow. That's quite a compliment, Lady Nel.\nThank you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nDo you feel any better?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nOh, yeah. Loads better! Being down in the\ndumps really isn't my style anyway.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026	Now I gotta sing my heart out every time I see\nyou. That way you'll never forget me!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nHaha! There is no need to concern yourself\nabout that.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028	The memory of you is etched forever on\nmy mind.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nHahaha, good! But that doesn't mean I'm\ngonna stop making up new songs.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030	Oh, but I've got one for you now! I call it "Riding\nthe Flavor Wave." Ready to hear it?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nNaturally.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
