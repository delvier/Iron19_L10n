MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI have. An old well, deep in a forest... A single\nsunbeam illuminating a lone flower in bloom...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou conveyed a perfect balance of warmth and\nisolation, light and dark. Just breathtaking.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nExactly! You saw all that right away,\ndidn't you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nYou would not believe how much time I spent\nhiking in the woods to find that view.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nBut to hear your experience, to know you\nunderstand, makes it all worth it!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nFinding beautiful things, then sharing them with\nfriends who would never see them otherwise...\x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nAw, sweet of you to say!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nBut if you're expecting more, I need to raise\nthe stakes.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nHey, maybe you could help me! There's a spot\nI wanna get to, but it's a tough hike.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nIt would definitely help to have a buddy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'd love to come along!\x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nNeed some water?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThanks...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nPhew.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWe've come a long way. Are we close?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nIf the rumor I heard in town is true, yeah, we\nshould be.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nRumor? We came all this way for a rumor?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nYep. Quite a rumor, though.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nThe spot we're looking for is supposed to have\na view worth any risk to see.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nIf it's even close to true, nothing can keep me\nfrom it. Not distance, not exhaustion, not thirst!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI admire your passion for your work, Rosado.\x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIt's definitely uplifting when someone can see\nand appreciate what you do.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nSpeaking of, we're almost there. Come on!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nThe drawing's important, but so's the journey\nto get there. Let's enjoy it─you and me!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nLead on, Rosado.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08ロサード\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYour rendition of that landscape came out\nstunning, Rosado.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI saw it on display in the café. Everyone who\nwalked by seemed to stop and stare at it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nOh, I'm so glad! It was worth the trip, right?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIt was. Even if we almost drowned crossing that\nriver on the way.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nAnd that pack of wolves that chased us?!\nI really thought we were going to die...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nBut that's all just fond memories now. And the\nview we found made it all worth it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nThanks again for coming with.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nI couldn't have drawn that piece without\nyour help.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI've been meaning to ask you, Rosado─is your\npassion for art really only about "likes"?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nWhat?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWatching you draw that day, it felt like maybe\nyou had another goal...beyond validation.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nI guess...I do?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nThe world is filled with so much beauty. Most\npeople only get to see a little of it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nTrue. It's impossible for people to see\neverything on their own.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nThat's such a waste, isn't it?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nThere are forms of beauty out there we don't\neven have names for. Unique, precious things.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nIf I can show people even a little more of the\ndiversity in the world, I'll be happy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nIt'll mean I've helped build a world where folks\naccept and appreciate each other's differences.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOpening minds by showing them new things...\nDidn't know you were such a profound thinker.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nHaha! Maybe I'm just showing off.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nNot at all. I have a lot of respect for you,\nRosado. Even more now.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nThank you. That means a lot.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nWanna join me the next time I go looking for a\nnew landscape to draw?\x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_RELIANCE_S_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nGlad we're on the same page. That should\nmake this easier.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nSince I'm currently the cutest person in your\nlife, there's something I want you to have.\x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_RELIANCE_S_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nHere it is. What do you think, Divine One?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nA hair clip? It's beautiful.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nNothing but the best. I got it back home, in the\nvillage of the fair folk.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'm grateful, but why are you giving this to me?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nBecause if you wear it, then you'll be the cutest\nperson in your life.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nMe? The cutest?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nThat's right. As an expert on the subject,\nI believe I'd know.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nIn fact, you wouldn't just be the cutest in your\nown life. You'd be the cutest in mine too.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nI'm sure you understand it isn't easy for me\nto admit something like that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nBut I can't help it. You're that special to me,\nDivine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThat deserves a like.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ロサード\nHehe, what?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'm glad you said something. I feel the same\nway about you, Rosado.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
