MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0A\x04エル\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nラファール\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nSister.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nSomething has upset you, Rafal. What is it?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nIs it not obvious? Already you are throwing\nyourself to the front lines.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	You have not yet fully recovered. Allow me\nto fight at the front instead.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nYour concern is appreciated. But with the\ndragonstone you gave me, it is unfounded.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	My ability to transform is no less than it was\nprior to the shattering of my own stone.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nThat is true enough.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nMoreover, as you know, my new stone was\nempowered directly by the Emblems.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	It is a piece of that which imparted to you your\nown power to transform.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nYes. We were fortunate that the dragonstone\nyielded by the Emblems was exceptionally large.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	That is why I was able to split the stone into\nfour pieces and give two of them to you.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	I was initially concerned that the split would\nreduce potency, but that has not been the case.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nIndeed. So there is no reason for you to be\nconcerned about me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nI will accept that...if you promise to call upon\nme the moment you are in danger.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nThank you. Should such a moment come, I will\ndo so.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nAnd I will be there.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0A\x04エル\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nラファール\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nRafal.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nYes?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nI am concerned about your wound. You were\nreckless about protecting me in the last battle.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	One misstep and that cut could have been fatal.\nIs it healing properly, at least?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nIt is, thank you. And yes, I am told that if the\nslash were slightly to the right, I would be dead.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	I was healed with a staff, but evidently there\nwill be permanent scarring nevertheless.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nThis is entirely my fault.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nA scar is a small price to pay for the opportunity\nto protect you. I would do it again.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nPlease refrain. I beg of you.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	You cannot possibly think that I would be\npleased to see you sacrifice your life. Do you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nNo. I do not.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	Even so, I cannot bear the thought of you\nbeing hurt again.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nI understand how you feel.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	But I do not understand why you must be\nso... Ugh!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nI watched over you for a thousand years after\nyou sacrificed yourself for my sake.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	I spent every waking moment of that time\nkeenly aware of the depths of my foolishness.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	A fear that you would never wake held me\nconstantly in its grasp. It nearly drove me mad.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nRafal...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nHear me. I will do anything not to lose\nyou again.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	Protecting you is all I care about. Whatever may\nbecome of me, I am prepared to accept.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	And if you truly understand how I feel, that is\nall I need say. Now, I will take my leave.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nWait! Please, listen...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023	How can I make you understand?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0A\x04エル\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nラファール\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nI see that your injuries have been treated. Good.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nYou have been waiting all the while. I apologize\nfor taking up so much of your time.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nThe time is irrelevant. That hit, on the other\nhand, was meant for me. And you stole it.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	I said I would protect you, no matter what\nbecomes of me. Do my words mean so little?!\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	If your aim is to trample my heart, then so be it!\nBut do not make yourself a martyr!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nHm-hm. The shoe appears to have found its\nway to the other foot.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nNel!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nI understand you are angry. But now you will\nhear me.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	The thousand years you spent in watch passed\nme by in an instant.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	In our native world, we were never truly twins.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	One might say it is because we could not be\ntwins that we fought against each other.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nWhat is your point?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nNow, in this world, everything has changed.\nWe share a dragonstone.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	Do you not see? That makes us true and equal\nhalves of a whole.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	And if that is so, then your protection of me\ncannot be one-sided.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nIf your wish is to protect me, and not to be\nprotected in turn, then we will never be equal.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	If we are two halves of a whole, then I must\nprotect you as well.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	Your pain is my pain, and your joy is my joy,\nand your fear and your hardship are mine also.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	So do not tell me ever again that what becomes\nof you is irrelevant.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\n...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	You are absolutely right. Please pardon me for\nmy arrogance.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	I have allowed my fear of losing you to govern\nmy entire relationship with you. That is wrong.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	We are indeed equals─halves of a whole. I beg\nyou, forgive my impudence.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nThere is nothing to forgive. All that you have\nsaid and done has been out of love.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nHow is your wound? Tell me truly.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nIt is likely to remain with me forever. Yours?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nThe same. For the rest of my life.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nHm. Twins with matching scars.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nNo need to be so happy about it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nOn the contrary, this scar is proof that I have\nbeen a shield for my brother.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#032	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nHaha... You are impossible. There is no\ncompeting with you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#033	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nA laugh now...and a smile as well? This day\nwill live forever in my memory.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#034	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nA smile? Never. You must have imagined it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#035	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nYou cannot fool me, Rafal. It is impossible.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#036	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nWhy, because we are two halves of a whole?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#037	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nPrecisely.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#038	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nMy mind is your mind, I suppose. Let it always\nbe so, dear sister.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#039	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nIndeed.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
