MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0A\x04エル\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x12\x0Cセレスティア\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nLady Nel, would you like something to drink?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nThat will not be necessary.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nHow about something to eat? I brought\nsome bread.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nI am not hungry.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI suppose I can eat this later, then. Perhaps you\nshould get some rest.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nZelestia.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nWhat is it?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nYou have, of late, been fussing over me a\ngreat deal. Why?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nWell, I, um... I was unable to protect you in a\npast battle.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	I don't want that to happen again, so I decided\nto stay by your side and keep you safe.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nThe sentiment is appreciated.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	But our relationship is no longer hierarchical.\nWe now aid the Divine Dragon as equals.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	You served me well in our world. And I consider\nyour duty in that regard fulfilled.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nIf that's how you feel, then I suppose I should\ndo as I please from now on.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nVery good. Then I bid you farewell.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\n♪Hm, hm-hm-hm, hmmm...♪\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nYou are following me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI hope you don't mind. This is what it pleases\nme to do. I want to stay by your side.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0A\x04エル\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x12\x0Cセレスティア\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nZelestia. I wonder if you have considered\nforging some...new friendships.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nNew friendships? What do you mean?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nI mean creating bonds with additional people,\nthereby broadening your perspective.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nOh, heh... If that's what you want, I'll do my\nbest to follow your orders.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nThat was not a command.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nFor you, Lady Nel, I'll befriend hundreds of\npeople! Whatever it takes to make you happy!\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nYou are crying.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI'm so sorry. I tried to make friends, but I\nwas unsuccessful.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nTell me what happened.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI'm not sure. I made an effort to try talking to\nmany different people...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	But most of them ran away when they saw\nme coming.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	The rest kept talking about Zephia and The Four\nHounds. Things I don't fully understand.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	The conversations got uncomfortable, and I\ncouldn't tell them that I wanted to be friends.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nHmm...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nDo you think it's because I'm a Mage Dragon?\nPerhaps it's too hard for people to accept us.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nNo. We dragons can certainly form close bonds\nwith the little ones.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	The Divine Dragon demonstrates that fact time\nand time again.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	And there is no reason you cannot do the same.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nThat's true. But then...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nIf you are apprehensive, then perhaps I should\naccompany you as you make your efforts.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nWould you?! I would greatly enjoy an outing\nwith you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nHm-hm. Very well. Then it shall be so.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nHm-hm, yes!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0A\x04エル\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x12\x0Cセレスティア\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nLady Nel! I went to town today and talked with\neveryone again!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nAnd forged a number of new friendships, by the\nsound of it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI did, hehe! And it's all thanks to you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nI merely helped to remind you of the courage\nyou already possess.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	It seems you require no further assistance\nfrom me in this matter.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nActually... There is still something else I was\nhoping you could help me with.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	I know this is probably out of line and too bold\nof me, but...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	Lady Nel, would you forge a friendship\nwith me?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nI must decline.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nWh-what?! You...you don't want to be\nmy friend?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	I knew it. You hate me!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nOf course not! Please do not misunderstand.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nWhat do you mean?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nI apologize for my brisk tone. It is merely the\nway I am accustomed to speaking.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	I must decline to forge a new friendship with\nyou because we already have an existing one.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nOh, we're...already friends?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	That's wonderful!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nYou are crying.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nBecause what you said just made me so happy.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	Wait, am I dreaming? I must be dreaming.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nYou are not dreaming, Zelestia. And, without a\ndoubt, you are my dearest friend.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nYour dearest friend? I'm honored, Lady Nel.\nYou are my best friend as well.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	I want to stay by your side as your best friend\nforever. Please let me attend you going forward!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nWhat?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nAre you thirsty? Would you like something to\neat, perhaps?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nOur dialogue appears to have come full circle.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI can't imagine anything more wonderful than\nto be by your side as a friend, Lady Nel.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nIf it pleases you this much, then it cannot fail\nto please me.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029	I am glad beyond words for our friendship.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
