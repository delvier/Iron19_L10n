MID_WU_C_1_IN_#001	Food must taste especially delicious here.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#001	Good morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#002	Would you like breakfast down below?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#003	Or perhaps I could bring it up here for you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#001	It seems I have a bit of time.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#002	While I wait, perhaps I'll sample these herbs\nI grew.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#003	Mmm. This one has a spicy note to it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#004	And this one... Mmm...yes, a subtle sweetness.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#001	Divine One...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#002	May I ask your opinion?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#003	Which of these herbs do you prefer?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#004	Give them a taste and, please, be honest.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#001	Are there no new flavors to explore?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#001	Divine One!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#002	Is there anything in this room that I might taste?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#003	I'm always on the hunt for new and unique\nflavors, you see.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#001	I don't see any ingredients here. A shame.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#002	Though, there is that pillar and, of course,\nthe bed. They're not ingredients per se...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#003	Still, I can't help but wonder what they\ntaste like.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#004	They are pure white and certainly look\nquite delicious.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#001	Good morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#002	Sorry to bother you, but might I have a taste\nof that pillar or even your bed?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#003	No. I'm not joking. Why do you ask?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#001	I've noticed that the Divine Dragon sometimes\nhas difficulty waking up.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#001	Ah, well, apparently not today.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#002	I shall make you a warm breakfast at once.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#001	Today, it seems, is one of those days.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#002	Well, there's no better way to wake up than\nto the smell of food.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#003	Let's see... Chop the ingredients, add a bit of\nheat...now a dash of seasoning...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#004	And it's nearly done...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#001	Good morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#002	What do you think?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#003	Do you like waking up to the sounds and smells\nof cooking?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#004	Eh, before you answer...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#005	You'll want to wipe the drool from your mouth.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#001	Why... Yes, I smell an unfamiliar dish once again.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#001	Is that aroma coming up from downstairs?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#002	Pardon me, I'll be right back...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#003	I must check on something cooking in\nthe kitchen.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#001	It does not seem to come from the Divine\nDragon's clothes.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#002	I mean surely...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#003	the Divine One wouldn't spill food that\nmany times.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#004	But where could it be coming from?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#001	Divine One, please, what is that smell?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#002	What?! You've been hiding a nighttime snack\nall this while?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#003	Eh...that is hardly advisable.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#004	Food should not be stored at room temperature.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#001	Ugh... I'm at a loss for fresh new meal ideas.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#002	Ah, I've stumbled upon the Divine\nDragon's room...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#001	I'm sorry.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#002	I was wandering, lost in thought, when I so\nrudely woke you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#003	Please, let me make it up to you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#004	I'll bake a sweet treat for you one day soon.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#001	Your hair, Divine One...every time I see it, I'm\nmesmerized by how unusual it is.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#002	Ah! An idea! I'll use the same ingredients...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#003	but employ a unique method of preparation!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#001	Good morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#002	And thank you, Divine One!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#003	You have helped me out of a culinary funk.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#004	Your uniqueness...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#005	has inspired a unique dish.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#001	This room has me thinking about...baking\na cake.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#002	Yes...it could be beautiful.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#001	I think I'll cook something for you again,\nDivine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#002	This place you once slept in for a\nthousand years...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#003	has given me a sweet idea.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#001	Hmm, if I'm baking for the Divine Dragon...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#002	I must not think only of flavor, but of\npresentation too.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#003	Ah! Perhaps I could bake a cake that looks\nlike the entire Somniel itself?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#001	You are awake, I see.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#002	Now that those tomato and blueberry eyes of\nyours are open, I must tell you...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#003	you've fueled my creative appetite once again.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#001	Breakfast is ready.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#002	It is time to get up, don't you think,\nmy dear partner?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#001	Haha, now be honest.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#002	Was it the word "breakfast" that stirred you\nfrom your slumber...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#003	or was it your excitement to see me?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#004	I choose to believe it was the latter.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#001	As I expected. Still asleep.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#002	Well, I've prepared a sweet dish for you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#003	It is sweet like our relationship is now and,\nI hope, always will be.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#004	Life is full of so many different flavors, and I've\ntried to taste as many as I could.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#005	But this time we share together, it tastes like\nnothing else I've ever encountered.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#006	Our recipe is unique and perfect, and it belongs\nto us and us alone.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#001	Now, eat up so you can win your battles.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#002	Tomorrow, and the day after that...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#003	I want to watch you taste all life has to offer.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#004	And I want to be there to make sure...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#005	it's delicious.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#001	No food from me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#002	This time I've brought you flowers, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#001	You know...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#002	I enjoy growing flowers and herbs.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#003	Now, next time I come...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#004	you must tell me something about yourself.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#005	I want to know everything. The sweet things,\nand yes, the sour things too.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#001	When you gave me the ring...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#002	you said there was so much for us to learn\nabout each other.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#003	I want to learn everything about you, and\nI want to tell you everything about me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#004	You should know, I'm growing these flowers\nas a hobby.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#005	They're my favorite species.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#006	Its red petals are so bright and bold.\nAnd the blue bud...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#007	Its scent is almost as sweet as you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#001	Good morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#002	Now be honest, do you prefer my delicious food\nor my beautiful flowers?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#003	Though, you need not worry...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#004	I will be happy to wake you with both from\nnow on.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
