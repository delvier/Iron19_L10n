MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#002	I find it hard to get out of bed.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#003	I troubled my family's servants to no end.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#001	I've brought a gift of jewels to coax you out\nof bed!\x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#002	I found a full bottle of milk outside!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#003	After that pebble...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#004	things left on the ground have been catching\nmy eye...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#001	A milk bottle today, tea leaves yesterday...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#002	And some metal the day prior.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#003	I leave most items alone...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#004	I won't bring all of them to you like I did with\nthat roadside pebble.\x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_WU_A_1_IN_#001	Oh! There's dirt on my clothes...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#002	I should have stopped...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#003	for a change of dress.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#001	Morning! I squeezed in a bit of training before\ncoming here...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#002	I apologize if I seem unkempt.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#003	I do hope you'll forgive me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#001	Still, I can't neglect my training.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#002	I have to work hard to make up for my lack\nof ability.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#003	We're all capable of growth...\x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_WU_A_2_IN_#001	I brought a bouquet of herbs, Divine One!\nI picked them this morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#001	Aah.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#002	These herbs are said to rouse one from sleep\nwith a refreshed feeling.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#003	So? Have they worked their magic on you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#001	You seemed to enjoy the bouquet I brought the\nother day...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#002	so I thought I'd bring you another!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#003	They'll last longer when dried...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#004	so you can enjoy them for a long time.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#001	Oh! I thought I might leave them by your pillow.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#002	But I'm glad you're awake.\x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#002	Showing me gems first thing?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#003	A rare gift...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#004	I'm talking about your eyes, of course.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#005	They're so dazzling in the morning. They shine\nlike the sun!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#001	I picked some wild flowers for you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#002	You like gifts like these...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#003	isn't that right?\x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#005	to see friends smile.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#006	Your smile is particularly infectious...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#007	so you might need to make room for even more\ngifts from me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#001	Rise and shine, hehe!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#002	Mornings with you...\x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#003	I'm also caring for the ring you gave me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#004	It's undoubtedly my most prized possession.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#001	Ah, fast asleep.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#002	I should buy you a beach somewhere so you\ncan get more rest.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#003	No, no. That won't do. You prefer gifts from\nthe heart.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#004	I didn't bring anything like that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#005	I have nothing to offer...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#006	Oh, wait. Of course. I know the perfect gift.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#007	I'll give you my undivided attention. I won't\nleave your side until you wake up.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#001	Ah! You woke up!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#002	I was just, uh...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#003	Well, I was trying to give you a gift.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#004	It didn't last very long, but it's the thought\nthat counts.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#005	Isn't that right?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
