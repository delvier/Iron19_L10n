MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nヴァンドレ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nPhew, I've hit my limit for training today.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nExcellent work, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nI brought a hot towel for your face. I think you\nwill find it most refreshing.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThank you, Vander. That's very kind of you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nI have also prepared a fresh change of clothes\nfor you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nWhen you change, deposit your dirty clothes\ninto the basket, and I will wash them for you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI appreciate your generosity, Vander, but I'd\nprefer to take care of my own laundry.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nCertainly you have other tasks to keep\nyou busy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nMy only obligation is to you, Divine One. Feel\nno hesitation in asking me for anything.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nBut...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nIt has been my duty to wait on you since long\nbefore you awakened.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nWere you to assume my duties for yourself, my\nposition would cease to exist.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nSo please, leave these trivialities to me─where\nthey belong─and trouble yourself no further.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nAgain, I appreciate your willingness to help me,\nbut I do feel a bit bad about all this.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nThere is nothing in all of Elyos to feel bad\nabout, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nNow I must insist you change out of your damp\nclothes before you catch yourself a cold.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nヴァンドレ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nDivine One, I have finished repairing and\npolishing your weapons.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThank you, Vander.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nI have also prepared all of the materials you will\nrequire for the war council tomorrow.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nPlease do take a moment to review them\nsometime today.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'm sorry, but I can't do this.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nDo what, precisely?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nVander, do you think I'm unreliable?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nWhat? Goodness, no! \x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nWe are mortals, and you are the Divine One─\nour magnificent leader, if you take my meaning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nFor you to perform lowly tasks that are mine\nto execute is most gracious, but uncalled for.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'm sorry, but I don't feel comfortable having a\nservant. That's not who I am.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nAh. Before I was your attendant, I was similarly\nengaged in caring for Queen Lumera.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nYour mother, perfect in mind and beauty, never\nlodged a complaint regarding my services.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nIn time, Divine One, I hope that you will grow\naccustomed to my work as your caretaker.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI respect my mother, and thank you for your\nservice to her. But...I'm not my mother.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'm my own person. I'm capable. I can take care\nof myself.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nI see...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nMy apologies, Divine One. I have pushed myself\non you. An old servant's habit, I suppose.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nI will honor your request and take more care\nin considering your needs, moving forward.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThank you, Vander. And, please, let me know\nbefore you do anything on my behalf?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThere are many times I will need your help.\nBut I'd like to ask for that help.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nヴァンドレ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nShall I attend to your weapons and armor,\nDivine One?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nNo need. I've got time, so I'll take care of\nit myself.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nUnderstood. Then I shall turn my attention to\nother tasks, by your leave.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThank you for being so diligent.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nOf course, Divine One. It is nothing. Nothing\nat all...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIs something troubling you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nMay I have but a moment of your time?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou may. What is it?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nSome time back, Divine One, you spoke of how\nyou and Queen Lumera are different people.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nHaving served humbly beneath you both, I have\nobserved quite a few similarities.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nIn fact, I observed some of your similarities\njust now.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHow so?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nYou are thoughtful and kind to everyone─in\nturn you are well loved by all you meet.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nIf there is any difference between you, I think it\nis only that you are still growing.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nYou have a bright, limitless future ahead. It is\nmy desire to support you in that future.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nVander, I...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nI hope that I have not offended you. I wanted\nonly to speak from the heart.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nNo, I'm happy you opened up to me like this.\nIt's as you say, I've still got a lot to learn.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIf I grow enough, hopefully I'll become more\nlike my mother─someone people can count on.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nI am certain that you can and you will, Divine\nOne. That is why I am here, serving you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nAs long as you're with me─guiding me─I can\nalso feel certain that things will work out.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nPlease continue to lend me your strength.\nSomeday, when I'm stronger, I'll lend you mine.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nOf course, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nヴァンドレ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nDivine One. I must admit to you a\ngrave confession.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOh? Go on...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nAs I wish to continue serving you, I feel it is\nprudent to tell you everything.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nWhen first I was dispatched to the Somniel to\nserve you, I was unhappy at the prospect.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou were?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nIndeed. Prior to serving you, all I wanted was to\nserve Queen Lumera until the very end.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nDespite my many protestations, Queen Lumera\ninsisted I watch over you in your slumber.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nI felt I was cast aside─useless as her servant.\nI arrived at the Somniel under a dark cloud...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI see... So what caused such a change of heart?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nInitially, I was simply carrying out Queen\nLumera's orders.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nBut now I serve you because I believe in who\nyou are─your heart and your will, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nVander...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nIt wasn't until Queen Lumera passed that I\nrealized she knew her time was short.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nThat is why she appointed me as your caretaker\nand directed me to assist you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nTo be entrusted with Queen Lumera's child is\nthe highest honor for any steward.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nIn my own foolishness, I failed to see it then.\nBut I see it now. For this, I must apologize.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThere is nothing to apologize for. Thank you for\nspeaking so honestly with me, Vander.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nDivine One, would you grant me the honor to\nswear my allegiance to you once more?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOf course.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nDivine One, I hereby pledge to you my\nundying loyalty.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nVander, I recognize you as my steadfast knight.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nTo honor that, I would like to give you this.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nThe Pact Ring? Such a precious thing cannot\npossibly be given to me!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOf course it can. I want you to have it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThis ring is handed down among Divine\nDragons, representing a special bond with them.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nSo there is no one more fitting than you, who\nhas served both me and my mother tirelessly.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nTo think...that I might one day be granted\nsuch an honor.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#028	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHah, I recall you saying something similar when\nI first awoke. You've been with me ever since.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#029	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nNow I ask that you stand with me until the\nvery end.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#030	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nIt is my honor! Divine One, I will follow you,\neven unto the ends of the world. \x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#031	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nTo be truly worthy of this ring, I will never again\nallow any harm to befall you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#032	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nI, Vander, swear to protect you. I will be your\nsword and shield, even should it cost me my life.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
