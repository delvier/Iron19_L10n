MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x12\x0Cセレスティア\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nZelestia, you still haven't taken a break?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nWell...no. I was still organizing the weapons.\nI'm almost finished.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou know, you can reach out to me at any time.\nI'd be happy to help you.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	All of these things you've been noticing and\ntaking care of for us have been really helpful.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI'm doing this because I want to. By the way,\nyou were wonderful in battle today, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	The bravery you show protecting your friends\nis inspiring, but all that effort requires rest too.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThank you. I'll get plenty of food and rest. You\ndon't need to worry about me.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	Speaking of food, wasn't today's meal so good?\nThat vegetable soup was delicious.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nOh, that does sound lovely.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nSorry, I didn't realize you hadn't eaten. I'm sure\nthere's still some left if you want to go now.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nNo need to apologize. I got busy and forgot. The\nlast time I sat down for a proper meal was, uh...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	Huh... A few days ago, I think.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWhat?! You need a proper sit-down meal.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nMeals take time, but I do snack a lot. There's\njust so much I want to do for everyone.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThat's no good. You're coming with\nme, Zelestia!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nUm, where are we going?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou have to eat properly if you're going to have\nenough energy for all this activity.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018	I'll be watching to see that you take time to sit\ndown and eat more.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x12\x0Cセレスティア\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nZelestia, I brought you today's lunch. Though\nit's a little late to call it lunch now.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nOh, thank you, Divine One. I lost track of time\nvisiting with everyone, and it slipped my mind.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThe same way it slipped your mind yesterday,\nas I recall.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nWell, I...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI can't believe you'd miss all the best meals if I\ndidn't keep track! It's a good thing I noticed.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI thought all dragons were like this, but maybe\nit's just me, heh.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	I've been trying to pay attention, but I get so\ndistracted by everyone else.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	If someone's in trouble, I want to help them.\nAnd if someone's worried, I want to listen.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	The other day, I was helping someone move\nsome heavy items. Before I knew it, it was dark.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nNot again.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI know. I'll just...eat what you brought me\nright now.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	Hehehe...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWhat's funny?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI'm so happy to be sitting here with you,\nDivine One. Even if I am the only one eating.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	It isn't just my stomach that's filling up, but my\nheart as well.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	Oh! Divine One, this soup is delicious! Please,\ntry a sip.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThank you, but I already had lunch. Besides,\nI brought this for you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nYou don't need to hold back. I wouldn't want to\nkeep something so delightful all to myself.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	Here. Say "aaah..."\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nUh...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nCome on now. Aaah...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nUm...if you insist. Aaah...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nHm-hm! How is it? Isn't it wonderful?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nUm, y-yes. Very...delicious.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x12\x0Cセレスティア\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nThere we go. Looks like everything is in its\nplace. Well, then...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nLet's get started.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nWe have been eating together a lot more often\nlately, haven't we?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'm just happy that you're taking the time to sit\ndown for meals.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	Well, not counting the times you get too\ndistracted by other things.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nIt is kind of you to show such concern. Thanks\nto you, I've been eating some delicious foods.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	Mealtime is a lot more fun since we started\neating together.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	And it's not just meals either. Everything I do\nby your side is more fun, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIt makes me happy to hear you say that.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	I was worried you might find things difficult\nhere, since this world is unfamiliar to you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nNot at all. I enjoy being here, especially when I\nsee you smiling.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	I will help you face any foe if it gives you more\nreasons to smile.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	I fear no enemy. I'll defeat them all!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHm-hm! That's reassuring, Zelestia. I feel\nthe same way.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	It's inspiring to be around you. You help me feel\nso much stronger.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nA lot has happened since I arrived here, but...I'm\nglad I came to this world.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	Please, allow me to go on standing by your side.\nRely on me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOf course. I feel like I can count on you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nOh, Divine One... Haha, you have some\nsauce on you. Hold still.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nNgh...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nThere. That's better.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	You must have been quite hungry to get sauce\non yourself like that. Hm-hm, how cute.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHey... I appreciate the thought, but I'm not a\nchild. How embarrassing.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x12\x0Cセレスティア\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nUm... Thank you for the food.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou're welcome! I hope you enjoyed it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nAh...yes...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nZelestia? What's wrong? You don't seem like\nyourself today.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI'm just feeling a little anxious.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWhy? Did something happen?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI'm afraid these moments of happiness won't\nlast. That the war will only grow more violent.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008	What if, starting tomorrow, we can't enjoy\nspending time like this anymore?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009	Or if you...or I...don't come back safely?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010	These meals have become a daily source of\nhappiness for me. But will there be a next one?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI had no idea you were holding on to\nthis anxiety...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI never thought the time I spend with you,\nDivine One, would bring me such joy...and fear.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013	War always requires sacrifice. I know this when\nI'm standing on the battlefield.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014	And yet... I don't know how I'd cope if I lost\nanother person dear to me.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015	I had friends in my other world who I thought\nwould be with me forever. Now they're gone.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI understand, especially after having to leave\nyour own world behind.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017	It will take more than just having fun and\nmaking friends to heal those lingering wounds.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018	I'm sorry to have made you worry.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nOh! You don't owe me an apology, Divine One!\nI managed to get worked up all on my own.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI care about you, and I don't want you to ever\nfeel this way again.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021	So, I'm giving you the Pact Ring.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nYou mustn't! The Pact Ring is far too precious.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI was planning to give it to you eventually as a\npledge that our time together will last.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024	We're close like family now, right? And families\nshare meals.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025	So let's continue eating together. Tomorrow...\nThe next day... For as long as we live.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nThank you, Divine One. I would be honored\nto accept this ring.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027	Haha, you've made me so very happy.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#028	I've always wanted to be someone you could\nrely on and let spoil you a little.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#029	Somehow I think you ended up being the one\nsupporting me, Divine Dragon \x0E\x06\x03\x00...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#030	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nYou have become my family. I will cherish you,\nand I swear to never leave your side again.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
