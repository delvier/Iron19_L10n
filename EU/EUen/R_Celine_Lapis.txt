MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08セリーヌ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ラピス\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nOh my. What is that you're drinking, Lapis?\nIt smells heavenly.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nPrincess Céline?! Uh... This is regular tea. Yep.\nNothing special about it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nDo you mind if I have a sip?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nWhat?! No! You're a princess. You shouldn't be\ndrinking this sort of thing.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nWhat's the harm in it? You seem to be suffering\nno ill effects.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nIt's not that. It's... Well...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nSee, I didn't get the tea leaves from a shop.\nI harvested them from a wild plant nearby.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nDo you mean that you make your own tea?\nThat's wonderful.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nNow I must insist that you let me try it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nUh... All right, if you insist. Here.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nThank you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nOh! This is bracing indeed! I wasn't quite\nexpecting the taste.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nYou like it? I actually made the tea set by hand\nas well.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nYou made this? Its finery would shame some\nartisans I know.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nI'm very impressed that you're able to make so\nmany things all on your own.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nI appreciate that, but really, it's nothing special.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nNonsense, Lapis. If it's not too much trouble,\ncould you teach me to brew tea like this?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nI'd be interested in learning which wild plants\nto pick and how to brew tea from them.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nI'd be happy to. Let's go to the forest together\nsometime and I'll teach you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nExcellent. I shall pay close attention, my teacher\nof tea.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08セリーヌ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ラピス\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nLet's see... The shrub over here is edible.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nIts leaves are delicious when boiled. You can\neat them or dry them and make them into tea.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nVery interesting.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nSee these berries? Now, you can't eat them.\nBut if you crush them, they make a nice salve.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nI've seen these grow everywhere and somehow\nnever knew they had such uses.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nThis moss here is great for treating burns.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nDry it, crush it into a fine powder, and mix it\nwith water to make a soothing ointment.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nWill wonders never cease!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nIf you're really that interested, there's much\nmore I can teach you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nI'm from a regular, well-to-do village, but I have\nfriends from impoverished lands.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nEverything I know about scavenging, I picked up\nfrom them.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nI ought to thank those friends of yours. They─\nand you─have taught me so much.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nThank you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nI have to say, I'm surprised to see a princess so\ninterested in this sort of thing.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nSurely there's no need for you to find tea in\nthe wild. You can just go to a shop.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nMedicine too. You can just buy whatever salves\nand ointments you need, right?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nUnder normal circumstances, yes. In times of\npeace, what you say is very true.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nBut in this time of hardships, nothing is certain.\nYour knowledge may prove useful.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nI suspect you have much more to teach, Lapis,\nand I am eager to absorb it all.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nIf that's what you want, Princess Céline...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nI'd be happy to share what I've learned over\nthe years.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nUh! From my friends' experiences, that is!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nHaha, I shall hold you to that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08セリーヌ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nLet's see... This herb should be dried and then\nrestored with water when it's time to ingest.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nThis moss can be dried and powdered, and it is\nconsumed to treat stomachache. I think that's it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nAnd of course, these leaves make a very\ninteresting tea when brewed.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ラピス\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nPrincess Céline? Are you writing something?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nAh, hello, Lapis. I was just recording the wisdom\nyou shared with me thus far in this journal.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nI thought you might read it over and let me\nknow if I missed any details.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nI'd be glad to. But I have to ask...why are you\ndoing this?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nPreparing for the worst, I suppose.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nWhat do you mean? There's no shortage of\nfood or medicine in the stockpile.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nOh, not for us. For my people.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nWhy would they need to know all this?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nFirene is a fertile nation, but I cannot rely on\nthat being true forever.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nAny number of events could despoil the land.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nIf that happens, I think the knowledge you've\nimparted could prove useful.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nI... I didn't realize you had such grand plans for\nthe information I was sharing.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nI don't intend to wring you dry by any means.\nI shall interview others as well.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nYou have your own duties that demand your\ntime, so I'll try not to impose too much.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nNo, it's all right. I'm glad to help however I can.\nPlease, impose to your heart's content.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nIf the skills I used to survive in a barren land\ncan come to good use...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nWell, I'm happy to share them!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nThank you, Lapis.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nBut, uh... I thought that you learned all this\nfrom friends.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nAHH!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nI... I'm sorry. I've been lying to you. These are\nall things I learned firsthand. \x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nTruly? Don't apologize, then. Firsthand\nexperience is much more valuable to me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nThank you for your honesty. Your cooperation\nin this matter means a great deal to me, Lapis.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nThank you, Princess Céline. I'm happy to be of\nservice to you and your people!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
