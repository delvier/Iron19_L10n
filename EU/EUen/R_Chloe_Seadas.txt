MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nHAAA!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nSeadall! I heard you shouting. What's going on?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nOh, Chloé. I'm in the middle of a very\nimportant reading.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nYou yell when you're reading?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nLook at this.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nRight here, before me...meat sizzling on the fire,\ndripping and juicy. Oh, how tempting.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nBut my dancing will be less than disciplined if I\nlet my passion for savory flavors rule me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nMy body is my instrument. I must be vigilant.\nSo, here I sit, consulting the cards.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nHah, sounds like fun.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nWell? What did the cards tell you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nAs much as it pains me to say, it appears I'm\nnot destined to eat this meat.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nMore for me, then!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nMoon and stars! I thought you'd protest at\nleast a little bit.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nOh well, go ahead. Though must you enjoy it\nso much?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nThanks for the meal, Seadall. Next time, it'll be\nmy treat!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nIf you say so. Sounds...delicious.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06クロエ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08セアダス\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nWell, Seadall? What do you think?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nIs this supposed to be...food?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nOf course it is.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nWhat exactly am I looking at? What are the\ningredients? How was it prepared?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nIt's eggs cooked in sugar.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nEggs...from what?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nFrom a rare fish caught in Firene's waters, for\nthe most part.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\n"For the most part"?! What kind of eggs are\nin here?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nThe delicious kind, of course. You've got\nnothing to worry about.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nOh, I'm worried all right.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nBut...you went to all this effort to bring food\nto me. It would be rude not to give it a try.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nUgh, the look...the smell...it's ruining\nmy appetite...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nFolk food isn't for everyone.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI'm sorry, Chloé. I don't think it's for me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nWhat a shame. This kind of thing might have\nbold flavors that won't trip up your footwork.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nWhat?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nYou found a dish...that's flavorful yet won't\ndistract my dancing?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI spoke too soon. I will eat your folk food.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nThat's great! Go ahead and dig in.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nHere we go...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nStill can't stomach it, huh?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nNo, it's...actually quite tasty. Bitter and sweet,\nbut I like that about it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nReally? What a relief. The flavor's so strong that\nI was worried you couldn't keep it down.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nYou wouldn't believe what I ate when I traveled\nwith the caravan. I have a strong stomach.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nMaybe sometime you could teach me more\nabout these kinds of dishes.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nI'd be happy to. And Seadall? Thanks for giving\nit an honest try.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08セアダス\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nAnd a one, two, three, four...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06クロエ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nI never get tired of watching you dance.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nChecking up on me, Chloé? I'd have set up a\nfront-row seat if I'd known you were watching.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nWell, I didn't want to interrupt your practice.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nBut I brought some new folk food for you to try:\nhoney-glazed gecko! It's good for you, I swear.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nIt looks...appetizing, as always. But thank you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nThe flavors are good. Unusual, no doubt, but\nI love the sweetness.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nAha! Just as I thought.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nI've brought you enough folk food to figure out\nthe secret─you'll eat anything if it's sweet!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI'm not sure about that...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nYou know, you really are a wonderful dancer.\nVery graceful, but with such power.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nDid someone teach you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nYes. I have a master─the teacher in the caravan.\nHe taught me to dance.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI guess I should say that I "had" a master.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nDoes that mean...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nHe died during a raid on the caravan. He was\nprotecting me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nOh no...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI never got a chance to repay my debt to him.\nIt's the only fate I couldn't foresee.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nBut your master's dancing lives on in you,\ndoesn't it?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI hope so. But I have a long way to go before\nI achieve his level of skill.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nStill, I do my best to mesmerize my audience\nthrough the sublime art of dance.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nI have no doubt you've done that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nHm-hm. Thank you, Chloé.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nAnd now that I've eaten, it's time to dance.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI was going to give you a special performance as\na thank-you, but how about we dance together?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nI would love nothing more.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
