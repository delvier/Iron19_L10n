MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nヴァンドレ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08パンドロ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nSir Vander, is it true you used to serve in Lythos\nunder Queen Lumera?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nYes, I was her attendant. Why do you ask?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nI just want to say that as a man of the cloth,\nI hold you in the highest regard.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nI would have given my left arm for such an\nhonorable station─in the Holy Land, no less.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nKeep flattering me and you may lose an ear\ninstead. I'll talk it off with my old war stories.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nPlease do! I'd love to hear about what it\nwas like.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nCertainly. Though perhaps we should find a\nmore appropriate place to talk.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nWhy don't you come to my next party?\nThat ought to be a suitable setting.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nHm. I'm not usually one for parties.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nOh, I'm sure you'll fit right in. It's just a small\ngathering at the church.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nYoung adherents praying for peace─some pious\nsinging and dancing. That sort of thing.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nWorship through song and dance? Why, that\nsounds marvelous.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nI see it as my clerical duty to help people find\ncomfort in these difficult times.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nI understand. You put on these get-togethers as\na kind of service to your congregants.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nExactly! So, would you care to join us?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nOf course. How could I refuse an invitation to\nsuch a sanctified gathering?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nWonderful! I look forward to seeing you there.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nヴァンドレ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08パンドロ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nThank you for coming to the party today,\nSir Vander! You really elevated the proceedings.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nPandreo, did my ears deceive me, or were you\nand the other guests...howling?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nOh, don't worry about that. Just a thing\nwe do when the spirit moves us.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nWe were riveted by your fascinating stories\nabout Queen Lumera.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nWell, that's good, but... Really, what bizarre\ngathering did I witness?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nYou spoke of pious songs and dances. I was\nexpecting something rather solemn.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nInstead, it was a circus! Everyone hopping\nabout and yelping like rabid dogs.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nCould you even hear what I was saying over\nall the commotion?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nOf course!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nThat was why we got so excited. We were\ncelebrating your stories in our bodies and souls.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nHm, is that so. Call me old-fashioned but...\nI usually celebrate stories by listening to them.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nI did notice you didn't dance with us.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nOf course not! This creaky back of mine would\nsnap if I cavorted around like that!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nStill, I appreciate your open-mindedness. In the\nearly days, some followers would complain.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nDid they now?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nYes. People in Solm don't tend toward religion.\nThe church used to be rather, ah, ill-attended.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nThen I had an idea that turned things around.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nTo make church more like a party.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nExactly! If you want people to listen, you have\nto speak in a language they understand.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nYou worked hard to rebuild your church.\nI apologize for calling it a circus.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nThough...unorthodox, your methods have clearly\nbrought in new worshippers. I appreciate that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nThat is high praise coming from you, Sir Vander.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nYes, well. Perhaps more flexible thinking is just\nwhat the world needs right now.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nヴァンドレ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08パンドロ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nHngh! Come on, Vander. Mustn't let those\nyoung folk show you up...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nVander, what's going on? Is this a training\ntechnique you learned in Lythos?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nNo! It's nothing! Now...go away!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nOh... I was just checking in as a friend. Sorry to\ndisturb you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nPandreo, wait. I was trying to...learn how\nto dance.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nOh, OK. You're learning how to dance.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nWait a minute. Learning how to dance?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nYes.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nBut I thought you had a bad back.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nShut up, will you! I am trying to understand\nwhat the young people get out of it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nBut these motions are...beyond me. I feel young,\nbut my body has no such delusions.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nAh, it's just that you're not used to it. Anyone\ncan learn with a little practice.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nHm. In that case, I suppose I'll keep at it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nHm-hm!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nYou're nothing if not steadfast. I admire that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nIs that one of those ironic compliments you\nyoung people enjoy so much?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nNo, really! Though you and I are from different\ngenerations, we share beliefs as holy men.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nI think learning from each other's experiences\ncan only benefit us both.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nLike with the stories you told at my party─\nI really appreciated hearing them.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nI am always glad to impart what I have learned.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nLet us continue teaching each other─for the\nchurch's future, and indeed, the world's.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nAgreed!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nTo that end, I will master this dance so that\nI may "boogie down" at your next party. Hup!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nヴァンドレ\nURGH! MY BACK!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nOh! Sweet mother of─ How is it bent like that?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
