MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08ヴェイル\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nマデリーン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nLady Veyle, forgive the interruption, but I'd\nlike to formally introduce myself.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nHuh? Marni, is that you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nMadeline, actually. Pleased to make\nyour acquaintance.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nOh... Yes, of course. Nice to meet you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nAnd you. I swear, as a knight, I will do all I can\nto support you in battle.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	You know, Mauvier told me about you... He said\nyou were strict but kind and noble.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nMauvier? You must mean...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nSorry, yes. The one from my world.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	But from fighting by your side, I believe you're\nquite similar to the Veyle he spoke of.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nThank you.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	Really, that's kind...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nIs something wrong? The way you're looking at\nmy face...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	Oh no! Do I have something in my teeth?\nExcuse me while I find a mirror.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nNo, it's not that... You just look like someone\nI used to know.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	Your smile... It reminds me of hers. She had\nsuch a lovely smile.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nHow kind of you to say so. My parents liked to\nsay that one's face reflects one's inner self.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	So in complimenting my smile, I feel as if you're\npraising my very soul.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018	Not that praise is what ultimately matters. As a\nknight, I care only about doing what's right.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nYou don't...care about praise...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020	...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nOh dear! I meant no offense. Really, I did\nappreciate the compliment.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nIt's not that. You've been perfectly kind.\nThis is my fault.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#023	Please, excuse me. We'll have to chat some\nother time.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nOf course, Lady Veyle... I look forward to it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08ヴェイル\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nマデリーン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nMadeline, I'm sorry for getting so emotional the\nlast time we spoke.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nNo need to apologize, Lady Veyle. I just hope\nthat you're all right.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nI am. But I want to talk to you about something.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nCertainly. It would be my privilege to hear what\nyou have to say.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nThank you.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	You see, it's about a knight named Marni.\nSomeone you resemble.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	When I was fighting against the Divine Dragon,\nI was under the spell of an enchanted helmet.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	Marni tried to break this helmet, and she\nmanaged to put a crack in it.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	Thanks to that brave act, I regained my senses.\nI feel that I owe her my life.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nJust the sort of courageous act I'd expect from\none of your knights.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nYes. But because of it, Marni was killed.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nWhat?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nShe gave her life for mine, and I didn't have a\nchance to thank her or say goodbye.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	I know that you're not her. But I still wanted to\nexplain my feelings.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nI see.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	You're right─I'm not Marni. But I believe I know\nhow she felt.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	A knight's duty is to lay down her life for those\nshe serves. For you, I am sure she did it gladly.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	And what a wonderful knight that makes her,\nto have fulfilled her purpose.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nBut don't you see? It was my fault she died.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nForgive me if I am overstepping, but given the\nchance, I doubt she'd do anything differently.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nHuh?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nIn her situation, having carried out my duty as\na knight, I would have no regrets.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023	And I would feel great pride to be remembered\nwith such fondness.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nI hope so... You're very kind, Madeline.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025	You know... If Marni were alive, I think she'd\nbe a knight like you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nI take that as a high compliment.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08ヴェイル\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nマデリーン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nLady Veyle, I'd like to thank you for sharing\nMarni's story with me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nIt was no trouble at all. Thank you for\nhearing it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nI can't imagine how it felt to endure losing\nsuch a brave and loyal knight.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	And to continue fighting with that pain in your\nheart... You must be quite strong indeed.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	Please, know that this isn't idle flattery.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	I just think you've done so well.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nYou think I've...what?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nApologies. I just felt that you deserved praise\nfor standing tall after that tragic loss.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	I am speaking well above my station, I know.\nBut it needed saying.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nOh dear! Lady Veyle. Forgive me for speaking\nout of turn yet again...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nNo... These are tears of joy. Mauvier told me\nwhat Marni's last words were.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	At the end, Marni said exactly what you told\nme just now.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	"Tell her she's done so well." You had no way\nof knowing that, but still you said it.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	Finally, I could hear her parting words for\nmyself... I can't stop crying!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nI... I see.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	Well, then.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	Lady Veyle. Will you take me as your knight?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nWhat?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nI cannot replace Marni, and I don't intend to.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	But I want to take up her role... To protect you\nand remain by your side.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nOh, Madeline.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	I can't tell you how glad your offer makes me.\nBut I'm sorry. I have to say no.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nOf course... I'm not strong enough.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nIt's not that. You're a splendid knight.\nBut you're not my knight.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026	Marni may be gone, but still, she will always\nhold that place for me.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027	I wish I could give you a different answer.\nBut that's how I feel.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nI understand.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029	Marni is lucky to have served someone with\nsuch a devoted heart.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nBut instead of my knight... Can I ask you to\nbe my friend?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nYour friend?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#032	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nYes. We can chit-chat, share laughs... See what\nthe future holds...together.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#033	I want you to be there when I become a dragon\nwho saves the world. What do you say?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#034	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nI'm honored. Yes, I will gladly be your friend.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#035	I'm not sure how good I'll be at it, though...\nI haven't had much practice.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#036	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nTo start, you can be a little less formal. If you\nhave questions for me, please go ahead and ask.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#037	Otherwise, it's as simple as being there when\nwe need each other. How does that sound?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#038	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nPerfect. It sounds simply perfect.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
