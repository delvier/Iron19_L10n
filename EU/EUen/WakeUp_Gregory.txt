MID_WU_C_1_IN_#001	Can I come in?
MID_WU_C_1_IN_#002	Or will I get in trouble?
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#001	Sorry to wake you.
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#002	Though, I guess that's why I'm here in the\nfirst place.
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#003	Good morning, Divine One.
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#001	I'm scared to wake the Divine Dragon, but...
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#002	I don't want to fail at this either. What to do?
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#003	Maybe if I start...
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#004	by whispering...
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#001	Good morning, Divine One.
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#002	Sorry. I hope I didn't frighten you.
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#003	I'll try to wake you more gently next time.
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#001	The Divine Dragon's room...
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#002	There aren't any traps in here, are there?
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#003	Nah, no way.
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#001	Ah, you heard me coming in.
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#002	Did I startle you?
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#003	...
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#004	I know that feeling well.
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#001	Hello?
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#002	I thought I was too loud.
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#003	How do I do this? I don't want to be too scary.
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#004	Maybe if I whisper... There's nothing worse than\nbeing startled awake.
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#005	Wake up, Divine One...
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#001	How'd you sleep?
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#002	Is it OK...
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#003	for me to be waking you up?
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#004	Your expression seems to say it is.
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#001	You're always so busy...
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#002	No wonder you'd be struggling to wake up.
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#001	Oh. Don't you want to sleep longer?
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#002	I was prepared to wait by your side for a while.
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#003	Please, don't force yourself.
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#001	Honestly, you shouldn't be taking on so much.
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#002	You're always caught up in some kind\nof trouble.
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#003	If only you'd look after yourself...
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#001	Morning.
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#002	I'm glad you're awake.
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#003	Though you did sleep in a teensy bit.
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#004	Don't worry...
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#005	I won't tell anyone that.
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#001	Ouch!
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#002	I stubbed my toe...
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#003	Ugh, it hurts so much...
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#001	You're awake?
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#002	I, um, stubbed my toe.
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#003	Watch yourself on those stairs...
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#004	'cause this really hurts.
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#005	OK... Bye.
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#001	Those stairs are rough.
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#002	I envy you, all cozy in that fluffy bed.
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#003	I bet if we added some stuffed animals...
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#004	it'd be even more comfortable.
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#001	Divine One.
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#002	If you want to sleep better...
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#003	you should get some stuffed animals.
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#004	Cuddling them always helps me.
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#001	I hate to bother you...
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#002	but I was asked to wake you, so...
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#001	You want to sleep longer?
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#002	I get it.
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#003	There's nothing better than a comfy bed.
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#004	Though it does make it hard to get up.
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#001	Hey, are you still sleeping?
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#002	Oh, come on...
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#003	If you won't wake up...
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#004	I'll flick you on the forehead.
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#005	Like you did to me the other day.
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#001	Hah, that woke you up.
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#002	It was just a little flick. But I tried to be gentle.
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#003	The last thing I want is to see you hurting.
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#001	Now that I think about it...
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#002	we never had to wake the other Divine\nDragon up...
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#001	Sorry, was I mumbling too loud?
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#002	I was just reminiscing a bit.
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#003	Waking you up is kinda fun.
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#001	You know...
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#002	I never saw you sleep in the other world.
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#003	What an odd realization.
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#004	Now that I think about it, were you\nalways awake?
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#005	Surely not.
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#001	Morning.
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#002	You really need to be taken care of, don't you?
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#003	Oddly...
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#004	I'm starting to enjoy doing it.
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#001	You're still sleeping?
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#002	Oh no...
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#003	I just realized...I think you're kinda cute when\nyou sleep.
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#001	Good morning.
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#002	I'm glad you woke up so quickly.
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#003	Oh, why's that?
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#004	Because if I stared at your sleeping face\nany longer...
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#005	my heart would beat so fast...
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#006	that my chest would ache with joy.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#001	You look so peaceful.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#002	I'd like nothing more than to stay here...
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#003	and gaze at your blissful sleeping face.\nBut since I'm here...
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#004	I'm gonna put my life on the line...
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#005	and fight fearlessly to protect you.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#006	I promise, from now on...
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#007	no matter how much it hurts...
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#008	I'll be fine.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#009	So long as you are safe.
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#001	You're up.
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#002	Let's try to get through the day unscathed.
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#003	Just run to me...
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#004	if things feel too dangerous.
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#005	I swear to protect you.
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#001	I'm here to wake you, partner.
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#002	This is kinda embarassing.
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#001	Did you get up quickly just to reassure me?
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#002	Thank you...
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#003	Knowing you'd do that...
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#004	makes me want to spoil you...
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#005	and do all I can to make you happy.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#001	Oh, Divine One...
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#002	When you gave me the Pact Ring...
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#003	my whole world grew brighter. Thank you\nfor that.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#004	I've felt so warm and fuzzy ever since then.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#005	But I shouldn't get so carried away.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#006	I can only hope to one day make you feel\nsafe too.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#007	The truth is, my love for you keeps\ngrowing stronger.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#008	I'd happily spend my life shielding you\nfrom pain.
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#001	Morning.
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#002	Battle calls again. And this time, I won't\nrun away.
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#003	Before I go...
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#004	Perhaps I could hold you for a few\nquiet minutes.
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#005	When we're in each other's arms...
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#006	that's when I truly feel safe.
