MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08セリーヌ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06クロエ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nOh, hello, Princess Céline! You look radiant\nas ever.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nThank you, Chloé.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nWe have some free time today. How do you\nintend to spend it?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nThat's a good question.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nWhy don't we take a ride on your pegasus to\na nearby tea farm?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nI'd be thrilled!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nMind you, we don't have that much free time.\nI doubt it would be like it was before.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nIf only I could return to those days of whiling\naway the hours with you...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nPrincess Céline?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nOh well. Let's do something else.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nWhen this war ends, I'll take you wherever you\nlike, as often as you like.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nWe'll visit all the tea farms in the world.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nAnd we can pass the time taking in beautiful\nlandscapes while sipping delicious tea.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nNow, doesn't that sound lovely?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nIt does indeed. Wonderful idea, Chloé.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nI shall hold you to it when the time comes.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nAnd I will be happy to oblige.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08セリーヌ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06クロエ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nHeh heh. Hm-hm.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nMy goodness. Is my face so funny that you'd\nlaugh as soon as you see it?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nForgive me, Chloé. Though, I wasn't laughing\nat you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nRather, it was the memory of the first time we\nmet that has me so amused.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nOh yes, how could I forget? My first encounter\nwith the princess...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nYou were at the harbor with your face\nscrunched up in tears. It was adorable.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nI wouldn't say I was in tears!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nThe ship I meant to board couldn't set sail,\nand I was grasping at straws. That's all.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nWhich is when I made my entrance.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nI told you if there was someplace you wanted\nto go, I could give you a ride on my pegasus.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nAnd off we went to the tea farm.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nI'd snuck out of the castle incognito before,\nbut this was something altogether different.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nI'd never ridden a pegasus. I can remember my\nexcitement like it was yesterday!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nThe first of many grand adventures.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nThat day is burned into my memory forever.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nWhen they told me you were the princess,\nI nearly keeled over with shock.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nI mean, how many people make friends with a\ngirl who turns out to be royalty?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nHeh heh, I'm sorry. I hope it wasn't too hard on\nyour nerves.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nOh, it was an honor. Like I was living a real\nfairy tale!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nYou might say I started a new life that day.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nIndeed? You must elaborate.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nOh, I'd be happy to. But not today.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nNo? I have the time, if that's your concern.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nHmm-hm! Oh, Princess Céline. The best fairy\ntales leave the audience wanting more.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08セリーヌ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06クロエ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nThe day we met was a fateful one for me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nEver since, I've kept watch for things that just\ndon't happen in real life.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nWhatever do you mean by that?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nUntil I met you, I led exactly the kind of life\nyou'd expect.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nI'd fantasize about things that might happen in\nstories, but I knew it was just a fantasy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nBut the day I met you was the day I found\nmyself living in a fairy tale instead.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nAnd if it could be true for that one day, why\ncouldn't it be true all the time?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nYou certainly have bravery enough to be a fairy-\ntale heroine, Chloé.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nOh, Princess Céline. You don't have to\nflatter me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nHaha, it was no mere flattery, only the truth.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nBut you were saying that our meeting started\na new life for you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nYes.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nThat day, I made up my mind to do whatever it\ntook to become your knight.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nWhy is that?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nWell, it seemed to me that becoming a knight\nwas the only way for me to live my own life.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nRather than the one dictated by my parents─or\nby my birth.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nThat day was the turning point, when I began\nmy training.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nI remember how startled I was to hear that you\nwould be my retainer.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nHmm-hm, I bet.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nNow imagine how my family felt about it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nIt's no exaggeration to say that meeting you\nchanged my life.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nOh, Chloé...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nI could say the same for you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nYou are a precious friend and a thoroughly\ndependable retainer.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nIt has been a joy to have you near. Thank you\nfor your service, Chloé.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nI look forward to seeing the rest of the fairy tale\nthat we weave together.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nMe too, Céline.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
