MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x12\x0Cアルフレッド\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nラファール\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cアルフレッド\nHm─ Yaa!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nYou.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cアルフレッド\nA little more!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nYour attention, please!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cアルフレッド\nHuh? Oh! Hey, Lord Rafal. You seem a little out\nof sorts. Anything I can do to help?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nCease your sweaty grunting at once. It is\ndisruptive to my peace of mind.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cアルフレッド\nSure, I don't mind training a little more quietly.\nSorry about that. \x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nThat is insufficient. I demand that you stop it\naltogether. The mere sight of it disrupts me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cアルフレッド\nI can't just stop working out, but I'm sure we\ncan find a compromise. Let me think...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	Hey, I know! Why don't you join me?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nI beg your pardon?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cアルフレッド\nIf we train together, the noise of it won't bother\nyou at all.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	Come on, it'll be fun!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nI have neither the time nor the patience to\nendure this pointless farce.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cアルフレッド\nEveryone says stuff like that at first.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	Give it a chance, though. With me as your\npersonal trainer, you'll definitely come around.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nEvery moment spent talking to you is a waste.\nIf you intend to stay, then I will go─at speed.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cアルフレッド\nCome on, Lord Rafal! Oh wow, he's got great\nform. What a powerful stride!\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019	Hey, wait for me! I'm up for a run too!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nUgh... What is wrong with this man?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021	What are you doing?! Stop following me!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x12\x0Cアルフレッド\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nラファール\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cアルフレッド\nWhew! You're an amazing runner, you know.\nA real natural.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	I've upped my running game since last time,\nand I still can't keep up with you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nI am a dragon. No mere human can match me.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	I exceed you without effort. All of your toil is\nfruitless. If you were wise, you would give up.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cアルフレッド\nSorry, Lord Rafal, but I just can't agree with\nyou there.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	My workouts aren't pointless. My body is\nliving proof of that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nWhat do you mean?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cアルフレッド\nWhen I was young, I was fragile and weak.\nNo one thought I'd live a long life.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	But when my father got sick and died, I swore\nI'd fight for my own health as hard as I could.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	For my mother and sister's sake, I worked to\nmake this body strong enough for anything.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nFor your sister's sake, you say.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cアルフレッド\nI've been working out constantly ever since, and\nthe results speak for themselves.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	I wouldn't be able to keep up with you and the\nDivine Dragon in battle if I didn't work for it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nI understand. It seems I owe you an apology for\nmy harsh condemnation of your exercise.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cアルフレッド\nWow... You really mean that?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	I knew you'd come around! It was only a matter\nof time until you got on board with working out!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nSlow down. I said no such thing.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	I have, however, grown weary of running.\nPerhaps it is time I tried something new.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	If you can recommend a form of exercise that\nwill actually hold my interest, I may partake.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cアルフレッド\nNothing to it, Lord Rafal. I've got you covered!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x12\x0Cアルフレッド\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nラファール\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nUgh! See if you can withstand this!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cアルフレッド\nGood, but not good enough!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nNgh! Hyah!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cアルフレッド\nYour lance hit my neck, mine hit your chest.\nLet's call that a draw.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nUnacceptable. You would be the clear victor if\nyou had used your dominant hand.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cアルフレッド\nMaybe, but I'm way more used to lances than\nyou are. I think a draw's fair.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nVery well. But let us have another go after our\nbreak, now that I have the measure of you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cアルフレッド\nSounds good. Hey, can I ask you something?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nSpeak freely.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cアルフレッド\nYou seem like you're actually enjoying training\nlately. Any particular reason?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nI lay the blame for that at your feet.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cアルフレッド\nMe? Why?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nYour past reminded me of my own. I, too, was\nweak in my youth. Always falling behind.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	Ashamed to rely on others for protection,\nI began a lifelong pursuit of strength.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cアルフレッド\nThat does sound kinda like me, yeah.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nOur paths began in the same way, but mine\ndiverged significantly.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	My thirst for power grew so strong that I was\nwilling to hurt anyone to gain more.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	Strength without compassion is worse than\nuseless. I see that now, in part thanks to you.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	My heart is no match for yours. But perhaps,\nwith training, I can protect those I care about.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cアルフレッド\nYou can and you will. I'm sure of it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nAllow me to ask you something in return.\nWhy do you spend time with me?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	Firene worships the Divine Dragon, and you are\nits prince. You should despise a Fell Dragon.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cアルフレッド\nI don't like to label people that way. I'd rather\ngo by what I see.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	When I look at you, I see a good guy. You like\nworking out now, so how bad could you be?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025	Besides, we're cut from the same cloth. I kinda\nthink of you like a brother.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nA much older brother, surely, but the point\nis well taken.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cアルフレッド\nActually I was thinking of myself as the older\none, since I've got more experience in training.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nRidiculous. A gulf of years lies between us that\nyou can scarcely fathom.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cアルフレッド\nWhy don't we settle it with a rematch? Winner\ngets to be the big brother.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nYou will regret proposing such a wager,\nlittle brother.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cアルフレッド\nHeh-heh... Bring it on!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
