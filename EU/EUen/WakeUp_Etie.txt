MID_WU_C_1_IN_#001	Hello!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#001	Rested up, Divine One?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#002	Glad to hear it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#001	The weather's great today...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#002	so don't sleep through it!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#003	Let's go! Get that blood flowing!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#001	Morning!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#002	C'mon, open up those eyes.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#001	Let's make this quick, Divine One. I've got a lot\nto do.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#001	Great, you're up. So, are we done here?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#002	If that's all you need, I'm gonna go for my run.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#001	Since I'm waiting anyway...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#002	I'll start my routine now.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#003	Hyah! Ngh! Hyah! Ngh!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#001	Ah... Oh, hey!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#002	Didn't see you wake up.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#003	Fine morning, isn't it?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#001	Here I am to get you up and moving.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#001	You woke up right away.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#002	Are you actually a light sleeper, Divine One?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#001	What's the best way to do this?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#002	I'd give you a nudge, but...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#003	that just feels rude. I'll nudge the altar you're\nsleeping on instead. Ugh!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#001	Nope! No good!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#002	Why's that thing so heavy, Divine One?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#003	I'd better train harder for next time.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#001	Phew! That's a hundred laps around\nthe Somniel!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#001	You got right up.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#002	That mean you wanna run too?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#003	I could handle some more laps.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#001	You know...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#002	I'm even more into running now.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#003	I've left all those pesky lingering doubts in\nthe dust.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#001	Morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#002	Feeling groggy?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#003	There's no better cure for that than a run.\nWhat do you say?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#001	OK... Let's do this nice and quiet.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#002	Easy does it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#001	You're already up?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#002	I thought for sure...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#003	I was lighter on my feet than that!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#001	I brought you my favorite Firenese flower.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#002	No nicer smell in the world.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#003	This should be good to wake up to.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#001	Good morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#002	How'd you like the scent of Firene?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#003	Someday I'll take you to a whole field full\nof those beauties.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#001	I made breakfast for you, Divine One!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#001	Looks like food's the key to getting you up fast.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#002	Well, feast your eyes! I made sure there was\nplenty of protein.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#001	Have you been using the muscle balm?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#002	It comes in different scents!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#003	There's peach, cookie, and tons of different\nherbs. There's even one that smells like tea.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#001	I think you should try...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#002	the spicy pepper scent.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#003	It'll pep you right up...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#004	so it's perfect for mornings.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#001	Hey! Your partner's here to wake you!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#001	Aw, you're already up? What a shame.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#002	I had something really nice all planned out.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#003	Hah, of course I know how to be nice!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#001	I've been wanting to show you Firene's\ngorgeous flower fields...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#002	but there's not a lot of time for sightseeing\nwith the war and all.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#003	I could have flowers delivered here.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#004	But even if I filled the room with them, it\nwouldn't be the same.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#005	Someday, though...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#006	we'll see those fields together. Promise.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#001	In the meantime, I'll press one of my favorite\nflowers for you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#002	Maybe I'll pin it, too, so you can wear it. I think\nthat'd look nice.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#001	Time for our morning run!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#002	Wake up, sleepyhead.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#001	Good, you're awake. Ready to go?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#002	Let's start with some stretches...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#003	and a few warm-up laps. Then we'll pick up\nthe pace.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#001	I took a few laps on my own before I came here.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#002	Sort of like you were doing for a while.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#003	Running alone is fine and all, but it's starting to\nfeel wrong to go without you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#004	I'm just so much stronger when I have my friend\nand partner with me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#001	Morning! Ready to get moving?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#002	All's right with the world...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#003	when we're running side by side.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
