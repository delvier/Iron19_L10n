MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nPracticing your dancing tonight, Seadall?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nAh, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nIt's not so much practice as it is performance.\nI have an audience tonight, after all.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nBut there's no one around.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nThere's the moon.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThe moon?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nThat's right. The silver light shining in the\ndark above.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nAnd the multitude of stars too. I perform for\nthem all tonight.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nDivine One, did you know that when people die,\nthey leave their form behind and become stars?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nMy teacher is up in that sky.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThis teacher of yours died then?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nHe did. These dance steps were the ones he\nloved most.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\n♪Hmm hmm hmm...♪\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIt's beautiful, Seadall. Every single movement\nis just...gorgeous.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI give up many of life's pleasures in pursuit of\nperfecting the craft of my dance.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nIt's not easy. I practice my steps intently, and\nI am vigilant about what fuels my dance.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nMy dancing skills are renowned in Solm.\nComplacency and mediocrity are not an option.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou're so disciplined. I respect that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nAnd there's something otherworldly about you.\nSometimes I'm not sure I should get too close.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nMay I resume dancing now?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOh! Yes, of course. I'm sorry I interrupted you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08セアダス\x022
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nSpirit of the cards! Moon and stars above!\nCast your divine light and answer me!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nSeadall? What is he trying to divine with\nsuch...desperation?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI beg you to tell me...will this food offer the\nperfect fuel for my dance?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI yearn for more than merely food. I crave the\nsavory! Please, spirit of the cards!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nUgh! That was not the answer I wanted!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nUh...he's not acting like he did before. Not at all.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nPlease, calm down, Seadall.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nDivine One!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI don't know what this is about, but this isn't\nlike you at all. Crave...the savory?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nAre you trying to tell me that eating this will\nprovide the perfect fuel for my dance?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nIt's dough fried in butter and then bathed\nin an oil sauce...and it's incredibly delicious.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOh, I had one of those. It was delicious, all right.\nI'd think it'd be extra fuel for your dance.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nAre you making that up?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWell...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nOr just guessing? I'll need to consult the cards\nfor the real answer.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI mean, I think I do know!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou're doing all that dancing. It's got to be\ngood fuel and tasty too!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nYou don't understand. A dancer of my caliber\nmust be disciplined.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nOn the battlefield, I must inspire all with my\nperfect dancing. So I must eat only perfect food.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nIf I'm careless, if my dancing suffers and\nsomeone dies... I can't allow that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nSeadall, I'm sorry...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nNow, I must retreat to the fortune shop, and to\na meal that is not fried.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08セアダス\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nSeadall, please, hear me out... I think your\ndancing is perfect.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nAnd enjoying the things you love every now\nand again won't change that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nWhat's this all about?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI understand that your dancing is as beautiful as\nit is because you're so disciplined.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nBut if you eat only to fuel the dance, you're\nnot thinking how savory feeds the soul.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nSavory feeds...the soul?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYour inner joy surely must also be part of\nyour dance, right?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWhen you danced in the moonlight thinking of\nthose who had died...that was truly beautiful.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'm sure that dancing while dreaming of savory\nfoods must be distracting.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nYou're trying to tell me my dance is less\nperfect because of this?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nFuel your dance with things that bring you\njoy─we will feel the joy too.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI understand that you want to dance perfectly\nto protect your friends in battle.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nAll the more reason to fuel your moves with\nsavory food too.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nDivine One, you don't understand.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nIf I fuel my dance with just anything I want,\nthat's playing with fire.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nMy life as a dancer has always put function\nbefore flavor.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nBut...I am starting to see what you mean about\nsavory feeding the soul.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nYou're very thoughtful and that makes me\nhappy. Thank you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou're welcome.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nAnd given you are the Divine One, I will take\nyour advice to heart.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nIn fact, that fried dough bathed in oil sauce\nfrom the other day─it's been on my mind.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThen let's go order some!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nNow the question is, how much savory is too\nmuch savory for one sitting?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nPerhaps we should consult the "spirit of\nthe cards"?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nAh, you saw my reading the other day.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nDivine One, I'm afraid you've only seen my\nundignified side lately.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI've seen your charming side as well.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI promise you this, from now on you'll see\na better me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI realize now the dance is both an inside and\noutside dance. Expect perfection!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'm happy if you're happy, Seadall.\x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_RELIANCE_S_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nA special dance?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nThat's right. It's a dance meant for an audience\nof one─for you alone.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nLet me begin.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006	\x0E\x04\x03\x04
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nSeadall, that was incredible. I'm genuinely\nmoved!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI did what you said. I fed my soul with savory\ndishes and let it move me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHaha! I'm really glad to hear that. But why the\nspecial dance?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nFirst, let me tell you what the dance means.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYes, please.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nThe dance is a promise─a promise I can\nperform for one person only.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nYou are very special to me, \x0E\x06\x03\x00.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI'll say it plainly. I've cared for you ever since\nwe met at that fortress.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nOthers hold you dear, I know. How could they\nnot? But their feelings can't compare to mine.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nSo I wonder, is it possible you feel something\nlike I do in return?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nSeadall, let me explain.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI'm sorry, that was incredibly forward of me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nNo, I'm happy you said it. I'm even happier\nyou feel that way. Because I feel the same.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nYou do?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI do. In fact, I've been thinking that this ring...\nwould look perfect on you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nThe Pact Ring?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThe very one.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI feel like the moon and all the stars have lit up\ninside my chest.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI promise you, I will work hard and make you\nproud to have me standing by your side.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHehe, you shine so brightly, I only hope I can\nadd a bit more glow.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#028	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nSeadall, I'm so happy we get to walk this\npath together.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#029	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\n\x0E\x06\x03\x00...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#030	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nNothing in this lovely, mysterious world could\nkeep me from you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
