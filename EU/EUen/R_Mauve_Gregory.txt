MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06モーヴ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nグレゴリー\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nYou are...Gregory.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nYeah.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nWe have a duty. These weapons will not\nmaintain themselves.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nRight, right...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nYour disposition is as lax as that of your\ncounterpart from this world.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	You perform well in battle, but whether you can\nbe trusted remains an open question.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	Perhaps I make you uncomfortable. You are free\nto go in that case─only one of us need remain.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nNo! I don't want to go and leave you here all\nby yourself. To work, I mean.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nHm.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nUh, s-sorry. In any case... Yeah, I want to stay.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nThis is going nowhere. Your motives are a\ncomplete mystery.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	If we are to make progress, we must have an\nopen discourse.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nDiscourse?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nWe should begin with an exchange of facts so\nwe both have the same information.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nWait... Mauvier, are you saying you actually\nwant to talk to me?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nDo you object?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\n...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020	...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nYou seem distressed.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nDistressed? No. I...I wanted to talk to you too.\nBut I was scared that you hadn't forgiven me!\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#023	Since I'd abandoned you, I didn't think I could\nshow my face. I'm so sorry...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nI cannot say that I understand, but I do hear\nyou at least.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nMauvier... I'll never leave you alone again,\nI promise. I'll always be by your side!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nThis is going to be challenging...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06モーヴ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nグレゴリー\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nSay, Mauvier?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	Even though we're talking, I...don't really feel\nlike you trust me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nIf that is so, it is unintentional on my part.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nOh, OK. Well, I still thought you should know\nthat I took over for Mauvier─in my old world.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	That's how much you trusted me. I mean, not\nyou, but the you back there.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nI believe you. And you do seem like someone\nI could potentially trust with my life.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nWhat was the me in this world like? You were\nin the Four Hounds together, right?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nAre you sure you want to know?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nWell, yeah. I mean, it's a little unfair to know\nnothing about him. I told you about my Mauvier.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nYes, you did. With a great deal of emotion.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	Very well, if you insist. But I warn you, the tale\nis not a pleasant one. You should steel yourself.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nIf you're trying to scare me...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nWhat I am about to say has not been confirmed\ndirectly by him, but it is the truth as I know it.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	Your counterpart, abandoned by his parents,\nwas taken in by a church of the Fell Dragon.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nOK... So far, same as me...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nUnlike you, he discovered early on that he\nenjoyed pain. Receiving and inflicting.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	Rumors suggest he considered his own pain\nto be spiritual─an offering to the Fell Dragon.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	It was that fanaticism that earned him Zephia's\nattention and an invitation to the Four Hounds.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	In those days, I hear he was almost incapable of\nordinary conversation. A complete pariah.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nI-I can see why! Who would want to be friends\nwith someone who liked pain?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	What about the Four Hounds? How did they\nget along?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nNot well. Our tenuous bonds were shattered by\nthe death of one person.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nThe death of one person... Was it me?\nOr Zelestia? Madeline?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\n...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025	Marni, this world's Madeline, was killed by your\nand Zelestia's counterparts.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nWhat?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nThey called her death a waste. They laughed\nover it. I could not forgive them, so I defected.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#028	When I look at you, I see his face. Perhaps that\nis why I have been unable to trust you fully.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#029	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nI can't blame you. If he did something that\nhorrible... Well, I understand your attitude now.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#030	Sorry, I'll stop bothering you. Thanks, um...\nThanks for talking to me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#031	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06モーヴ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nグレゴリー\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nAre you all right? You seem distraught.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nNope. I'm fine. Everything's fine.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nIt is only natural to be upset by my recounting\nof those events.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	If it was more than you could bear, allow me\nto apologize. I should be more considerate.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nIt's fine. Really. I was the one who asked.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	If he did all that... Well, I wouldn't trust\nme either.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nCircumstances have changed. I know now that\nyou are not capable of doing the things he did.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nObviously! I'm not that kind of guy.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	I'd never kill an ally, and I...I wouldn't abandon\none to fend for themselves either!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nI believe you. I am certain you would risk mortal\nperil to protect your friends.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	For that, you have earned my trust.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nOh, really? Heh, you don't know what it means\nto finally hear that.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	Thanks for believing in me, Mauvier.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nHuh?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nWhat? I say thank you, and you just stand\nthere staring at me like that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nYour thanks caught me off guard.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	It made me realize that, in all the years I knew\nGriss, he never once thanked me. For anything.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\n'Cause we're not the same person.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	I mean...the "me" of this world sounds like a\nhuge weirdo, to put it lightly.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nHa, indeed.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nWhat is it?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nOh, nothing. I was just thinking, I'd never heard\nMauvier laugh before.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nPerhaps. But as you rightly pointed out, we are\nnot the same person.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nHeh, exactly. Even if we do look like them\nat times.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026	We're still just us. Let's keep up the good\nwork, Mauvier.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nAgreed.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
