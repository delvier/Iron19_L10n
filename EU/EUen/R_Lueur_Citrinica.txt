MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nIf it's not inappropriate, I would like to find a\ngift for you to fully express my gratitude.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nA gift? That isn't necessary, Citrinne. I only did\nwhat anyone would have done.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nHaha! Oh, Divine One. You're too modest!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nAha! A gift idea has just come to me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nAn acquaintance of the Brodian royal family is\nlooking to sell their private island─at cost!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nWhat would you say to your own private island\ngetaway? My treat, of course.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nAn entire island?! That's really not─\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nNot enough. I agree. Shall I add some of my\nantique jewelry? It's just a few generations old...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nNo! Citrinne, I don't need expensive gifts.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nReally? Then...what sort of gift would you be\nmore inclined to accept?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWell, if I can't talk you out of it...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nTo be honest, I would prefer the kind of gift\nthat money can't buy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nSomething that money...cannot buy?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nNo private islands. No jewelry. I value gifts that\naren't defined by how much they cost.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThat's the best kind of gift a person can receive.\nDo you understand?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nI see. Let me just...think on this for a while.\nFarewell for now, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nシトリニカ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nHello again, Divine One. I gave your words on\ngifts some thought.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nYou said you would prefer something that\nmoney could not buy...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nI apologize for the delay. It feels as if I've kept\nyou waiting for days, weeks, months!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIt really hasn't been that long...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nTo me, it felt like an eternity.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nDo you have an idea?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nIndeed I have. I think this token of my gratitude\nwill be much more to your liking. For you!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOh. It's, uh...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nIt's a pebble!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYes. This certainly is a pebble.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nI found it sitting on the side of the road and\npaid nothing to acquire it. What a thrill!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nNo cost. No worth. I quite literally stumbled\nupon the perfect gift for you!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nIs something the matter, Divine One?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI guess I didn't explain myself well enough.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nImagine that you found this pebble a long time\nago and kept it. Maybe you grew attached to it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIf you were to give me that pebble─one you\ncherished─I would consider it a wonderful gift.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nOne that I...cherished?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou know, sentimental value? Worth that comes\nfrom the heart rather than the wallet?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nWorth that comes from the heart...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nI think I understand.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nNext time, I'll offer you something that will truly\ndelight you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nRest easy, Divine One! I shall return!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nシトリニカ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nHello once again, Divine One. I've come to\ngive you...this gift.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOh, Citrinne! What a gorgeous bouquet!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nI thought of you as I picked each flower. I hope\nthese will suffice...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou hand-picked all of these flowers for me?\nThat's a wonderful gesture.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nCitrinne? Are you OK?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nI once had a very close friend who loved gifts...\nand would make a game of begging for things.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nEach gift made her so happy. Over time, it\nbecame a natural part of our rapport.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nThen, one day, I surprised her with a bouquet\njust like this. She begged for a dress instead...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nWhen I asked if she didn't like the flowers, she\ngrew angry. She said I was being...cheap.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThat's awful. Is that why you offered to give me\nsuch expensive gifts?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nYes. That's why.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIf someone won't be your friend unless you buy\nthings for them, that isn't a real friendship.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI think this bouquet is a wonderful gift, Citrinne.\nIt makes me very, very happy. Thank you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nI'm so glad to hear it. I finally found the right\nway to express my gratitude.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nThat makes me very, very happy as well.\nThank you, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nシトリニカ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHere, Citrinne. Have a look at this.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nIs that a dried flower? It looks familiar...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIt's from the bouquet you gave me. I carefully\ndried each flower for use as a decoration.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nOh! Yes, of course! I'm delighted to see how\nyou've taken such good care of them.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI think of your kindness each time I look at\nthem, Citrinne.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nWhat a lovely thought. Thank you for sharing\nthis with me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI didn't call you over just to show you\nthe flower.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThis time, I have a gift for you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nYou do? For me? What might that be?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThis. The Pact Ring.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nWhat?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nBut this is a historic piece of jewelry. I suspect\nit's worth more than all of my riches combined!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nWhy would you give this to me?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nDon't think of how much it's worth. I'm giving\nthis to you as a token of our friendship.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI want you to be my closest confidant, Citrinne.\nAre you willing to walk and fight by my side?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nOh my...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nOf course I am, Divine One. I will happily accept\nthis gift.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'm so glad to hear it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nHeh, you know, I love to give gifts, but I rarely\nreceive them myself...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nYou were right about sentimental value. A gift\nfrom the heart is a wonderful gift indeed.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nCouldn't agree more.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nThank you, Divine Dragon \x0E\x06\x03\x00...\nI must be the luckiest person in the world.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nWhen this war is over, we must attend a formal\nball together. I know that's a long way off...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWhy wait? We could just dance right here\nand now.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThink of it as a formal-ish ball. Just for us.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nI'd like that very much.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nWhat a gift exchange this is─you and I both\noffering to support one another. It's priceless.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
