MID_WU_C_1_IN_#001	It's morning, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#001	You wake so readily.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#002	I envy you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#003	I find sleeping...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#004	and waking to be a struggle.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#001	I know I'm not the ideal person to wake you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#002	I am not exactly upbeat.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#003	But the sooner you wake...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#004	the sooner this will be over.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#001	Morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#002	Good weather today.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#003	Get some sun.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#004	You don't want to be gloomy like me, do you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#001	I wish I could visit you every morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#002	But it wouldn't be appropriate.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#001	You're awake.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#002	I suppose I will be going, then.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#003	I hope you get a more cheerful visitor tomorrow.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#004	Farewell.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#001	I never thought I'd be here.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#002	Waking the Divine Dragon...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#003	I have no experience with this sort of thing.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#004	I am frightfully nervous.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#001	Good morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#002	I'm not very comfortable here.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#003	But the opportunity to greet you, first thing\nin the morning...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#004	I couldn't pass it up.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#001	I've long wished for this.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#002	To stand in the Somniel...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#003	To pray at the holiest of altars.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#001	...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#002	Sorry to wake you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#003	I only came here to pray.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#004	I am finished now.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#005	Allow me to wish my deity a pleasant morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#001	Father told me...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#002	about Queen Lumera.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#003	She invited Elusia's royal family to visit.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#004	They never accepted.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#005	Until now, I suppose...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#001	Good morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#002	I came here to pray, if that's all right.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#003	I have something to say to Queen Lumera.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#004	Late as I may be, I accept the invitation.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#001	I hope I am allowed to be in this holy place...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#001	Morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#002	I'm grateful that you accept my presence here\nwithout complaint.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#003	Your kindness continues to amaze me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#001	Elusia may not like it...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#002	but I worship the Divine Dragon.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#003	As crown princess, I have been forced to keep\nthat to myself.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#004	At least until now.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#001	I wonder...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#002	What was it like for you to wake...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#003	after a thousand years?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#004	I wish I could have been here to witness it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#001	This place...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#002	I feel accepted here. Forgiven.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#001	Good morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#002	You seem so pure in slumber. So trusting.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#003	If that means you trust me...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#004	I'm glad.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#001	So much of the world is tiresome...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#002	but I never tire of being here.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#003	When I'm near you...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#004	I feel I can actually relax and be myself.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#001	Oh, you're awake.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#002	You think something humorous must have\nhappened to me?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#003	You noticed me smiling?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#004	Now that you mention it, I suppose I was.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#001	It's a relief to see you, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#001	Sorry to wake you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#002	I had a bad dream.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#003	I suppose I came to you for comfort.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#004	Childish, I know.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#001	I dreamed of...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#002	an Elusia in ruin.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#003	When I woke, my first thought was to come\nto you straightaway.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#004	I knew once I laid eyes on you, there would be\nnothing to fear.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#001	Did you hear all that?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#002	My weakness must be appalling to you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#003	Yet you look at me with such kindness in\nyour eyes.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#004	You're always saving me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#001	I've come to see you, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#002	Calling you that feels so much more meaningful\nto me now.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#001	Ah, you're awake.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#002	Sorry if I'm here a little early.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#003	I couldn't wait a moment more to see you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#004	Our time together is everything to me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#001	I have a confession.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#002	I find myself feeling a bit jealous...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#003	You gave me the Pact Ring...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#004	but you've given your Emblem Ring to others\nas well.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#005	It feels ridiculous to say this out loud, but...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#006	I wish I were the only one devoted to you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#007	I know that's terribly selfish.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#001	You're awake. Good morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#002	May I come closer?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#003	Thank you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#004	I cherish every moment that I'm close to you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#005	Every second that it's just you and me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#001	Divine One...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#002	You slept, just like this, for a millennium...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#001	I'm glad you're awake.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#002	We can't have you sleeping another\nthousand years.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#003	I think about that moment sometimes.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#004	You waking after so long... I wish I could have\nbeen there.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#001	You know...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#002	I owe so much to you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#003	I am strong enough now to endure the very\nhardest battles.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#004	And the worst nightmares.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#005	It's all thanks to you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#006	I love you, and I'll never tire of saying it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#007	Such a simple phrase hardly feels like enough...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#008	but no words will ever be sufficient to convey\nmy feelings.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#001	Good morning. Were you listening to all that?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#002	Well, good. I want you to know how I feel.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#003	And if you ever forget, I'm happy to\nremind you...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#004	just how much I adore you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
