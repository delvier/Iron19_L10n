MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ユナカ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nImpressive work out there today, Yunaka.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nWhoa, what? I got praise from the Divine One?!\nZappy! I'm thrilled! Beyond thrilled!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'm serious. Skills like yours are in high demand.\nYou must have been a mercenary or something.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nRight, um...mercenary! Yeah! You could tell?\nI mean...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nObviously I've merc'd a time or two.\nNo big deal.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI thought so. With strength like yours, you must\nbe pretty well-known too.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nUh, sure?! I mean, yup! People, ah...\nPeople know me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'll bet some of our allies are well acquainted\nwith your reputation already.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'll have to ask around. There must be stories.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nAah! No! I mean... Could I ask you to maybe...\nnot do that?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWhat? Why?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nBecause I lied. Again.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nI've never been a mercenary. You said it, and it\nsounded nice, so I went with it... I'm sorry.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'm confused.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nYou asked me about my past. I panicked.\nAnd just like always, I hid behind a lie.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nI'm truly sorry, Divine One. I should not have\ndeceived you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nYou were only trying to praise me, and I just\nhad to go and ruin it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nI'll take my leave.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYunaka...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ユナカ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nWhat can this humble liar do for you,\nDivine One?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'd like to have a talk, that's all.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nI understand. And I'm prepared to accept\nwhatever punishment you have in mind.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nPunishment? No. I wanted you to know how\ngrateful I've been to have you by my side.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nWait, what?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThat's how I feel.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou fight hard every day to protect our allies.\nThere's absolutely no reason to punish you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIn hindsight, I think the only reason you lied is\nthat we don't know each other very well yet.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nSo, let's change that. Why don't you start by\ntelling me something about yourself, Yunaka?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nHeh... Way to put me on the spot.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIf you don't want to, then I won't pry.\nSimple as that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nOK...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nBefore I joined up with you, I was sort of just...\nwandering. Looking for my place in the world.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nI'd left my old self behind me. Wanted to think\nI had, at least.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou don't sound very fond of your old self.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nOh, I like her well enough. Others, though,\nnot so much. That's why she had to go.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nBut I like who I am now, and honestly, I've\nbeen having so much fun since we met!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHaha, I'm glad to hear that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nGood talk, Yunaka. I think we should do it again\nsometime. What do you say?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nYou got yourself a deal.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ユナカ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWhat would you like to talk about\ntoday, Yunaka?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nThis isn't easy for me, but I want you to know\nwhy I've had a hard time telling the truth.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nSo I'm just going to lay it all out there, OK?\nThe truth is, I...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nThe truth is, I... I used to be...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIt's all right. You don't have to tell me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nBut I...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI can see how hard this is for you. It's obvious\njust looking at your face.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI told you before that I won't pry. It really is as\nsimple as that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nYou're really OK with me keeping a secret from\nyou like this?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOf course. I have secrets too, you know. There's\nno need to make yourself uncomfortable.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI only want to hear what you are ready to\ntell me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nThank you. Sincerely.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nWhat I'm ready to say is that I'm truly grateful\nto have a friend like you in my life.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nI feel like I've finally found that place in the\nworld I was looking for, you know?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nThat's entirely thanks to you, and I won't forget\nit. I'm glad to fight for you and all our friends.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI really appreciate that, Yunaka.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nI'll tell you all I can about my past, but I think\nthe present is what matters. Us, here and now.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nWe're just getting to know each other. There's\nso much more to say! It's like an adventure.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nAn adventure. I like that. I look forward to\ncontinuing this journey with you, Yunaka.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ユナカ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nOK, Divine One. It's time for me to come clean.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nI know you said you wouldn't pry, and you only\nwant to hear what I'm ready to say.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nBut I'm as ready as I'm ever gonna get, and\nyou have a right to know.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIf you're sure this is what you want, I'm here\nto listen.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nOK... Here goes.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nMy name used to be Larimar. I changed it to get\naway from my old life...as an assassin.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nGo on.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nI was never too attached to Larimar...or to her\nparents, who left her when she was young.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nShe is my past, though. In that sense,\nshe'll always be a part of me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nWhich means, even though I've moved on, you\ncan't know the real me without her.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIt was brave of you to tell me all that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI do want to know the real you. The value of\nthis conversation is not lost on me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nI appreciate that. Thank you, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOf course.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nSince you trusted me with your secret, Yunaka,\nI guess I'd better tell you mine.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nI didn't even know you had one.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWhen you told me how glad you were to fight\nalongside me, I wanted to jump for joy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nWhy?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nBecause somewhere along the way, I stopped\nbeing able to imagine my life without you in it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThere's no one more important to me than you.\nI want you by my side, always.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nSo I guess that's my secret.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nDivine One...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIf you'll accept it, I'd like you to have the\nPact Ring.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nBut that ring is precious to you...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou're precious to me, which is why I want\nyou to have it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWhether we're talking about your past self, your\ncurrent self, whatever─I cherish all of you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nYou're amazing!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#028	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nI want to know everything about you. I want\nto accept all of you like you've accepted me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#029	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nNo more lies, no more secrets. I want to be with\nyou the rest of my life. That's how I truly feel.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#030	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI feel the same way. Let's be true to each other,\nfrom now on, as partners.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#031	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nHappily, \x0E\x06\x03\x00.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#032	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nA new chapter starts today. I cannot wait to see\nwhat our future holds.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
