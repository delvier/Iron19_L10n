MID_WU_C_1_IN_#001	Waking the Divine Dragon...a strange\ntask indeed.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#001	Ah, you're already up, it seems.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#002	I'll save my wake-up services for another time.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#001	Sleeping soundly. This may prove challenging.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#002	I'll do a bit of dancing while I wait.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#003	Step...jump...turn...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#004	Ah, yes. Nearly perfect.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#001	Ah, good morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#002	Did my footwork wake you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#003	Well, perhaps...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#004	when the moon returns...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#005	I'll dance for you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#001	I read your fortune.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#002	It says two paths await you today. But which\none shall it be?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#001	Ah, you woke quickly. Your card is Le Cheval.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#002	The War Horse.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#003	It means a busy day awaits...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#004	and you should wear yellow.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#001	Ah, you sleep deeply. Your card is Le PÃ©gase.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#002	The Pegasus.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#003	Good fortune awaits...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#004	if you wear something blue.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#005	So the card says.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#001	Good morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#002	As I was saying...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#003	you may encounter someone special to you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#004	Oh, no.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#005	I would never suggest it would be me. I will\ntake my leave.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#001	Yes, this place...it's perfect for dancing.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#001	Ah, did I wake you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#002	I'm sorry. I was just looking for somewhere\nto practice.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#003	This altar...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#004	Surely it was made with dance rituals in mind.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#001	I'm sure many dancers performed for you here.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#002	If only you could have seen my master dance.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#003	He was beauty in motion.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#001	Divine One, I could dance for you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#002	Here, tonight. If you'd like.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#003	I could perform my master's dance.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#004	And share its profound beauty.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#001	Spirit of the cards, moon and stars above...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#002	please, tell me, would a midnight snack provide\nproper fuel for my dance?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#001	Ah, forgive me, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#002	My fortune telling was loud, wasn't it?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#003	It's so quiet here. I should've been more careful.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#004	I'll...leave.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#001	You see, I must be vigilant about the food\nthat fuels me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#002	It seems silly, but...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#003	I eat perfect food so I can dance perfectly.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#004	Though, a snack of honey and butter does\nsound perfect right now.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#001	I'm sorry.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#002	It's so late and yet here I am.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#003	I thought perhaps...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#004	you'd have words of wisdom for me...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#005	as you often do.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#001	Divine One, you should see the sky tonight.\nIt's breathtaking.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#002	Come, let's read the stars together.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#001	Ah, you're taking me up on my offer.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#002	The view of the stars from the altar...\nIt defies words...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#003	and pulls one's thoughts...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#004	far, far away.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#001	Or are you lost in dreams?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#002	I wonder...what do you dream about.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#003	I often dream about the desert's moonlit sky.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#004	Hah, even in my dreams, all I do is gaze at\nthe stars.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#001	Good evening.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#002	Now, make a wish.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#003	It may come true.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#004	Did you know, saying a wish out loud pulls it\ntoward you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#005	You see? A shooting star just sailed by.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#001	Today I dance with a full stomach and,\nmore importantly, a full soul.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#001	Ah, good morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#002	What do you say...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#003	we start the day with a dance?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#004	Please, Divine One...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#005	share this joy with me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#001	My breakfast was quite savory.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#002	A joyful fuel indeed.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#003	Thank you, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#004	You've helped me change.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#001	You're awake, are you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#002	Can you sense how happy I am? Can you see\nthe beauty inside?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#003	What I hope you see...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#004	is a better me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#001	Divine One, it's me. I'm here to wake you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#002	But I can study my cards until you decide to\njoin me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#001	Ah, good morning. I'm not surprised you\nwoke so quickly.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#002	No. I did not see it in my cards.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#003	Some things are obvious...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#004	when you know someone as well as I know you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#001	Ah, I've drawn Le Destin, the card of fate.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#002	There can be no doubt...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#003	Destiny brought the two of us together.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#004	The stars aligned...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#005	the very moment I first saw you in the fortress.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#006	And you, Divine One...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#007	You have woven our fates together ever since.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#008	I beg you, never let them come undone.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#001	At last. I was starting to worry you wouldn't\nwake up.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#002	Please, be careful out there today, and\nevery day.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#003	I can't have you join the stars in the sky\nwithout me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#001	The Pact Ring... I had this feeling it was guiding\nme here.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#002	Perhaps I imagined it?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#001	Or perhaps it was you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#002	Did you want to see me?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#003	I hope so.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#004	I hope you want to see me as much as I want\nto see you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#001	This world is shrouded in many mysteries.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#002	Was it you who guided me here somehow?\nAnd if so, for what reason?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#003	Perhaps it was so I'd dance for you once again.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#004	I'll dance for you just like I did the day you gave\nme the ring.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#005	And it'll remind you that I am yours,\nnow and always.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#006	My heart, my dancing, my everything... Every bit\nof it is yours, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#001	Ah...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#002	Now that you're up, it's time for breakfast.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#003	I know.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#004	Let's fuel our day with savory dishes while we\nsavor our time...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#005	together.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
