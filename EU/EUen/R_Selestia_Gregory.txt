MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x12\x0Cセレスティア\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nグレゴリー\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nGregory, how are you holding up? Do you feel\nlike you're adjusting to this world?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nI guess so? There are so many little similarities\nand differences to ours.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	I think I've mostly gotten used to it. I just hope\nwe can end this war quickly.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nThis place certainly has its own fair share of\nenemies to confront, doesn't it?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	Now that we're here, the Four Winds should do\neverything we can to support the Divine Dragon.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nI just wish Mauvier could have come with us.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI feel the same. It's because of Mauvier that\nwe're still alive.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nHeck, the reason we're even together right now\nis thanks to him starting the Four Winds.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	But then he was the first one to leave us. If\nonly I'd forced him to let me go in his place...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nDon't think that way. Mauvier wanted us to go\non living.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	He would want us to carry on his legacy. That's\nwhy he made you second-in-command.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nI still don't understand why he gave me\nthat role...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nProbably because you're so old.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nOuch! Is that supposed to be payback?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nHahaha! I'm only kidding.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	It's easy to see why he made you my second.\nYou fight so bravely to protect your friends.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nAll I did was run away. Sometimes I wonder if\nthat's what I'm still doing.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nWhat are you talking about? Don't be absurd.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nWhat'd I say? Why are you suddenly so serious?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nMauvier may have been the catalyst, but we all\nmade the choice to carry on his legacy together.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021	You are not running away. You're my second\nfor a reason. Believe in yourself.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nYeah...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x12\x0Cセレスティア\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nグレゴリー\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nMight I tell you an old story?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nDepends. How old are we talking?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nThis story is from before you joined us. Back\nwhen our Divine Dragon was still alive.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nOh, well, that's real ancient history.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI was on a scouting mission at Givre Port in\nElusia when I spotted some of the Corrupted.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	I was alone, but I couldn't ignore the threat, so\nI charged in. Incredibly reckless, in retrospect.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	They overwhelmed me. It was too late to get\naway. I realized I was probably going to die.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	That's when a lone figure came out of nowhere\nand started fighting to protect me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nYou don't mean...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI remember what he said. "This is when you run\naway. What will you do if you get hurt here?"\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nI did say that, huh? It's been so long, I'd\ncompletely forgotten.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nYou may be timid, but you risked your life to\nsave me. I don't understand it, even to this day.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nI guess...when I saw you there, all I could think\nwas that I needed to try saving you.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	I was surrounded by people who hurt me when\nI was young. No one ever came to help.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	I kept praying that someone would save me, but\nit went unanswered. Since I knew that pain...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	Well, it was unthinkable not to try and help you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI was so relieved. You were a ray of sunlight,\ncutting through my shroud of despair.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nWas I really that good? I mean, don't get me\nwrong, it's nice to hear you say that...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	But even when I ran in, I didn't think we could\nwin. I figured we'd both have to run away.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nWell, thanks to you, I lived to fight another day.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	More importantly... I knew I'd found a friend\nI could trust to watch my back.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	That's why I invited you to fight alongside us in\nLythos right then and there.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023	Haha! You were so scared of the invitation.\nYou panicked and turned me down repeatedly.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nHaha. But you were persistent. You always\nget your way.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025	I was surprised you even wanted to talk to\nsomeone like me. You had no clue who I was.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nYou charged into a dangerous situation to help\nme. How could I not trust you?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#027	Seeing that you were willing to risk your life for\na complete stranger gave me so much hope.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#028	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nHmm... Well, looks like my one day of bravery\nwas also the start of something big, huh?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#029	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nExactly. Do you see now that you're not\nrunning away?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x12\x0Cセレスティア\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nグレゴリー\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nZelestia...you call the Four Winds your family.\nWhat do you mean by that?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	Family was never really a good word for me.\nI'd imagine it was the same for the rest of us.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nYou'd be right. Each of us suffered difficult\nlosses before we met.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	I lost the Mage Dragons, you lost your home,\nMadeline her parents, and Mauvier...his master.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nI only heard Mauvier mention it once. He just\nsaid he regretted that he couldn't protect her.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	He said she died too soon because of him, all\nin some pointless fight.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nWe're all burdened with sorrows. Having a place\nto return to is what eases these burdens.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	None of us had something like that. I think\nthat's why Mauvier formed the Four Winds.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nI suppose it makes sense... But isn't that\ndifferent from a family?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI would have agreed at first. The Four Winds\nwere friends and allies, not family.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	After we spent time together, laughing and\ntalking, I realized we were filling those voids.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	The four of us have supported each other in a\nway others couldn't.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	It's something that can only be done by those\ncloser than friends─by people you deeply trust.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nThat does sound like a family.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nThat's what I believe. It's why we must look out\nfor each other.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	The Four Winds are family. If one of us is lost,\nthe rest still need to protect what we have.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	Even to the very last.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nAnd with you being a Mage Dragon, chances are\npretty good that'll end up being you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nWhat?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nOh! Nothing.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	I suppose I should ask, if we're calling ourselves\na family, who has what role?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI'm the mom. Mauvier's the older brother, you\nare the younger, and Madeline's the little sister.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nHahaha! A perfect match. Although, why am I\nthe little brother? And wait, where's the dad?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nOh, would you prefer to be the father?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nHah! Not likely.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026	And shouldn't you be more like an older sister\nthan a mother? You don't look old enough.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nAren't you the charmer, haha. But no... I love\nyou all the way a mother would.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028	That's why you can act a little spoiled around\nme. Oh, come now. Don't try to hide it.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029	Haha, see how we joke with each other? Just\nlike a family, wouldn't you say?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nYeah, I think so. Honestly...it's kind of a relief\nto hear you vocalize it.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031	Now and forever, the Four Winds will be a\nfamily─a safe place we can always return to.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
