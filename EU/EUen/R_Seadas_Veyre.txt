MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08セアダス\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08ヴェイル\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nSeadall, I've heard you're really good at\ntelling fortunes.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI am.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nOr I guess I should say...I was.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nOh. Does that mean you're...not good at\nit anymore?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nWell, I guess I'd say I'm in a bit of a rut at\nthe moment.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nHm. I didn't realize fortune-tellers could get\n"in a rut."\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nIt would seem so. Sometimes you just don't\nfeel it, and it shows in your readings.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nI see. Well, I was thinking of asking you to tell\nmy fortune.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nIs something troubling you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nSort of. I've been very tired lately. I was hoping\nthere might be some special way to fix it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI see. I'm afraid I can't be of much help\nright now.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nIs there anything you can do to get your\nfortune-telling powers back?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI don't really know. I think I just have to wait\nfor it to come back when it's ready.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nWell, how about you tell my fortune anyway?\nI won't mind if you get it wrong.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nWhat? But why?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nHumor me. I'll just assume your reading\nis incorrect.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nIf that's what you want. Let's begin...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nAll is revealed. Go to the market and act like a\ncat. Good fortune shall be given you back.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nAct like a cat...in the market? That's a little bit\nstrange, isn't it?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nDefinitely strange. I told you I'm all out of sorts.\nJust pay it no mind. It won't come true.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nHehe, if you say so.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08セアダス\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08ヴェイル\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nSeadall! Your fortune the other day. It was right!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nWhat do you mean?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nI did what you said. I went to the market and\npretended to be a cat. That is, I meowed a lot.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nReally? But I told you to ignore my reading.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nI thought I'd give it a try. You know, just for fun.\nBut then, something amazing happened.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nI meowed and meowed, and I sounded so much\nlike a cat, all the mice fled from the market.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nIt made everyone at the market very happy...so\nhappy, they gave me tasty treats to say thanks!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nIt was all so exciting that suddenly I wasn't the\nleast bit tired anymore. Your fortune was right!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nReally? It felt so...off when I said it. But if it was\nright on the mark, then...I'm back.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nThough, I don't think I'll be spreading that bit\nof news around.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nWhat do you mean?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nYou're very kind, Lady Veyle. You really are.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI lose my confidence, and you go and make up\nthis adorable story just to cheer me up.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nAnd it has cheered me up, so thank you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nDon't say that. I'm telling the truth! I really am!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nI will be very mad if you don't believe me!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nOK, OK. If it's going to be like that, then...\nI believe you. Satisfied?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nNow, since I've done as you asked and believed\nyour story, allow me to read your fortune again.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nIf that's what you want, of course.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nAll is revealed. Under a full moon, gather petals\nglowing gold. Then comes true a wish so bold.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nGather flower petals...that are golden and\nglowing...when there's a full moon?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nHow strange. I don't really understand what it\nmeans, but I guess I can try.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08ヴェイル\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nLook at these flower petals here. How strange.\nIt's almost like Seadall's fortune said.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08セアダス\x021\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nUnder a full moon, gather petals glowing gold.\nThen comes true a wish so bold.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nThe flowers you have there... I see you\nremembered my fortune.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nBut the flower petals are white, not gold.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nAre they? Hold them up to the full moon.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nHm? Like this?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nOh, how lovely! They're shining gold.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nThose flowers only bloom on the night of a\nfull moon.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nThe petals appear white but then shimmer gold\nwhen the moonlight strikes them.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nThey're so pretty!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nTheir fragrance is thought to have a soothing\npower as well.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI'd be happy if they could ease your pain even a\nlittle, Lady Veyle.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nThank you, Seadall. You went to a lot of\ntrouble to do this for me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI don't know what you mean.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nDon't be silly. You put together this whole\nbeautiful act just for me, didn't you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI assure you I had nothing to do with it. Also...\nA fortune-teller never reveals his secrets.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nOh, please...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nNow, I've repaid the favor.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nWhat favor?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nThanks to your kind gesture before, my fortune-\ntelling skills are back and as sharp as ever.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nThat's wonderful. I'm very happy for you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nYou know, Seadall, the moon is pretty tonight,\nisn't it?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nIt is. Very. I don't think I'll ever forget how\nbeautiful it looks tonight.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nNo. I don't think I will either.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nUnder a full moon, gather petals glowing gold.\nThen comes true a wish so bold.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nMy wish is to bring peace and happiness to this\nworld. And also...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nI wish for your happiness too, Seadall.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nSorry, did you say something?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nNo. I'm sure you're just hearing the sound of\nflowers blooming in the night.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
