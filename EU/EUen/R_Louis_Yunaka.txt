MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0A\x04ルイ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ユナカ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nAh, Yunaka. You're just in time.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nI am? That never happens. Wait, what am I\nin time for?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nWould you care to join me for tea?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nI greatly prefer to have company with my tea\nthan to drink alone.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nOh, that sounds like fun! Sure, I'd love to.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nSplendid. Here you are, then. Freshly brewed.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nDon't mind if I do.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nAhh... Wondiferous! This might be the best tea\nI've ever had. You're great at this.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nOh, you're too kind.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nI have ample access to high-quality leaves,\nthanks to the sterling tea field near my home.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nI started brewing tea for my family at a young\nage. I've had plenty of time to master the art.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nThat's amazing!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nYour family's got it made, getting to drink tea\nthis good all the time.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nHaha, possibly, possibly. And your own family?\nAre they in good health?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nOh, uh...my family?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nThat's, ah... Well, y'see...they're mostly...\nHow should I put it... They're just... Yeah...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nAh. I withdraw the question.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nI'm curious, Yunaka. Have you ever tried\nsugared grapes in your tea?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nGrapes? In tea? Sounds weird. Is it good?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nI shall prepare some for you. I hope you enjoy it.\nIt's my hometown's specialty.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nHow exciting! Thank you, Louis!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nHah, think nothing of it. I prefer to take my tea\nwith smiles whenever I can.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0A\x04ルイ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ユナカ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nLouis! Hey! Hi!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nHello there, Yunaka. Have you had a windfall of\nsome sort? Your smile is especially radiant.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nUgh, gross. Cut the sweet talk before I start\npuking rainbows.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nListen, I got you something. Just a little\nthank-you. Look, look, look!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nOh my. One look is enough to tell me that these\ntea leaves are very fine indeed.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nI expected nothing less from the master.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nYou've used so many leaves on me, I'm worried\nyou'll be a tealess husk if I don't give back.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nSo, I know it's not much, but I hope you'll\naccept the donation. It's for a good cause.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nI am all too happy to accept your gracious gift.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nI believe I'll brew them right away. You're\nwelcome to join me, of course.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nAre you sure? I don't want you thinking I got\nyou tea just so you'd brew it for me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nTea is better with two. I enjoy our bracing\nconversations almost as much as the tea.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nRight, conversations...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nI do enjoy chatting with you. So much so,\nI kinda worry I might...slip up.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nMeaning?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nHuh? Umm...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nAh, I just remembered I have a...thing! A thing\nI gotta do or else, um... Yeah, so next time.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nAh. That is unfortunate.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nI confess I was looking forward to spending the\nwhole time talking about myself.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nYou were, uh...planning to spend the whole time\ntalking my ear off about yourself, huh?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nYes. I'm just in that sort of mood today.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nOh! Well if that's the case, I can set my thing\naside. As a favor to you, I mean.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nI'm a great listener, so you can feel free to hold\nnothing back! Tell me absolutely everything!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nHaha, splendid. I shall put on a pot of tea for us\nat once.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0A\x04ルイ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ユナカ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nNo way! You're yanking my daggers! That can't\nbe a true story!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nIt can be, and it is.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nDuring my knighthood examination before the\nFirenese royal family, I treated everyone to tea.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nI showed promise as a tea connoisseur, which\nfactored directly into my gaining the position.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nI know you're great at it, but how is brewing tea\neven relevant to the test?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nIn their search for a retainer, it seems they\nprized domestic skills and martial prowess.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nLucky for you, you're the best. You had the\ncompetition tripping over their saucers, surely! \x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nHah! Why, thank you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nHonestly, Louis, I could listen to your stories\nall day long. They're that good.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nBut...I feel a little bad you're always going out\nof your way on my account.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nHow do you mean?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nYou go out of your way to do all the talking,\nso all I ever have to do is listen.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nI'm sure you've realized by now, but...I prefer it\nthat way. I don't like talking about myself.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nIt had not escaped my notice.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nIf I had to do it, I'd be forced to get evasive and\nlie to you. I don't like lying to my friends.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nThat's why it's better if I don't say much about\nmy past. Or about myself at all.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nWell, I see nothing wrong with that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nEven putting our pasts aside, I believe we two\ncan understand each other fairly well.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nYou think?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nSo long as we have tea and a friend to share it\nwith, we can discuss whatever we please.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nBesides, I'm rather loquacious myself, so it's\nnice to find someone willing to listen.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nListening can be a bit draining, so I thank you\nfor humoring me in that regard.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nAww, Louis...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nIf you feel you must contribute, we can discuss\nour countries, our friends, the future─anything.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nAre you sure you won't mind being friends with\nsomeone who never talks about her past? Ever?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nOf course I won't.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nI am friends with you as you are. Whoever you\nmay have once been is no issue.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ルイ\nNow then, if we are to keep this tea party going,\nI must brew us another pot.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nThank you, Louis.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
