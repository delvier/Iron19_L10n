MID_WU_C_1_IN_#001	I am here to awaken you, Divine One!
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#001	You're already up?
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#002	And all it took was my coming in.
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#003	You have the light sleep of a true leader.
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#004	Color me impressed.
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#001	Look at that. Sound asleep.
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#002	If some knave came in now, they could easily\ncut your throat.
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#003	Lucky I'm here to protect you.
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#001	Oh, you're awake!
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#002	No need to thank me.
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#003	And just know if someone tried to attack you...
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#004	I would give them a swift death.
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#001	Divine One, wake up!
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#002	Really. How much sleep do you need?
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#001	You got up just in time.
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#002	I trust you're feeling rested.
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#003	That seemed to be quite a deep slumber.
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#004	Now, please, hurry up and get ready.
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#001	This is bad. You're still not stirring.
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#002	I have no choice but to take drastic measures.
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#003	Forgive me for this, Divine One...
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#004	Ngh!
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#001	Phew!
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#002	I'm sorry for shaking your bed like that.
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#003	But merely making sound didn't seem to do\nthe trick.
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#004	Come on now. We'd better get moving.
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#001	Divine One, time toâ”€ Ew! A bug!
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#002	Oh, that's disgusting! It's right by your feet!
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#001	Ahh... It flew off. The little miscreant...
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#002	Must have left the room.
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#003	What a relief...
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#004	Please, take your time getting ready. I'll see\nyou outside.
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#001	Foul interloper!
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#002	I would kill you...
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#003	but the Divine Dragon said...
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#004	that it's better to resolve matters\nwithout violence.
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#005	So, instead...
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#006	Shoo! Shoo!
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#001	Ahh...
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#002	I followed your example...
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#003	and let that beast escape with its life.
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#004	Huh? What kind of bug was it?
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#005	Uh... The flying kind?
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#001	As a knight...
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#002	I perform with honor.
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#003	Even a task as simple as waking you up.
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#004	With that said...
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#001	Oh! You're awake. That's good.
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#002	I spent a long time thinking of ways...
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#003	to wake you up from your slumber.
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#004	But they can wait until next time.
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#001	Here we go.
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#002	I'll kneel before you and call out your name.\nThat way...
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#003	the first thing you see...
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#004	will be a reminder of my loyalty to you.
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#005	Ah! My foot slipped!
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#001	Forgive me, Divine One!
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#002	I intended to wake you in a dignified,\nknightly fashion.
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#003	But a clumsy error got in my way...
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#004	I'm going to go practice my footwork!
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#001	I was asked to take a break from training and\ncheck on you.
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#002	Hm... Mm-hmm.
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#003	All appears to be well.
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#001	Ah, good. You got up without any trouble.
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#002	That speaks well of your health.
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#003	And it certainly made my job easier.
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#001	Wait a minute...
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#002	Another bug! How did you get in here?
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#003	Ngh...
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#004	Come on... Climb on my hand.
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#005	There you go.
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#006	Let's not disturb the Divine Dragon.
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#007	We'll just go over here, and then...
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#008	Shoo!
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#001	I did it!
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#002	I took care of that bug all on my own!
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#003	Though I did wake you up in the process.\nApologies!
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#004	I'll just...see myself out!
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#001	It's so strange...
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#002	you sleeping out in the open.
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#001	Oh! Divine One. That was sudden.
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#002	Since you're awake, I guess there's no need\nto linger.
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#003	I'll take my leave.
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#001	In my world...
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#002	the altar was much more secure.
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#003	The Divine Dragon's quarters were off limits.
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#004	We rarely had permission to enter.
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#001	Divine One.
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#002	It's an honor that you allow me in this space.
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#003	I mean that.
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#004	I'd better go. I think this will be a good day.
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#001	It's so nice and quiet in here.
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#002	I almost never have a chance to enjoy\nthe silence.
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#001	Hm? Oh, please, Divine One. There's no need\nto thank me.
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#002	I'm grateful for the recognition, of course.
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#003	But as a knight, I'm only happy to do what's\nexpected of me.
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#004	Even if that's waking a sleepyhead like you.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#001	Still sleeping, I see.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#002	You know, when you gave me this ring...
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#003	you said I'm as important to you as Mauvier\nwas to me.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#004	Those words...
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#005	They made me truly happy.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#006	I hope you know, Divine One...
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#007	that you're important to me too.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#008	Someday...
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#009	Someday, maybe I'll say that when\nyou're awake.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#010	But for now...
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#011	I hope hearing it in your sleep is enough.
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#001	You heard that?
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#002	Well, I...
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#003	I was just rambling, all right?
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#004	I'm sorry... It's not easy to express my feelings.
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#005	But you can always count on my loyalty.
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#001	Time to wake up, Divine One.
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#002	Don't want to oversleep, do you?
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#003	As your knight, I can't allow that.
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#001	Haha, thank you for the compliment.
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#002	I don't normally care for praise.
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#003	But in truth...
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#004	when you praise me...
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#005	I don't mind it.
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#006	In fact, it makes me feel joyous.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#001	Hm. On second thought...
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#002	I think I'll let you sleep in. You look\nso comfortable.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#003	I know, I know. I was supposed to awaken you!
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#004	How dare I call myself a knight!
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#005	But I'll make up for it.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#006	I'll double my efforts in our next battle.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#007	Oh, your blanket's all bunched up. Here,\nlet me fix that.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#008	It's so tranquil here...
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#009	I wish I could stay in this room all day.
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#001	Hm-hm! Rise and shine.
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#002	I was planning to let you sleep in longer.
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#003	But I guess you're up.
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#004	Now, if I may compliment you...
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#005	You woke up all on your own.
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#006	Well done.
