MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nLady Veyle? You look shocked. Did something\nhappen?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nOh, it's nothing, um...Gregory. I'm sorry.\nPlease, don't mind me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nActually, I'm glad I ran into you. I've been\nwanting to talk to you for a while now.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	Instead of standing here, would you prefer to\nsit on that tree stump while we chat?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	Uh... I don't have anything to use as a blanket.\nI should have thought ahead.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nIt's fine. We can just talk while standing.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	Or you can sit on the stump. I'm fine sitting\non the ground.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nWhat? No. I could never ask you to do that.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	Please, take the stump. I'd feel terrible if you\nhad to sit in the dirt because of me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nI'm sorry. I didn't mean to be difficult.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nNo, don't apologize! I just...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	Wait, you're shaking. Are you OK?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nI'm fine. Seeing you...brings back memories.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nMemories of the me from this world, you mean?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	Judging by your expression, I'm guessing they\naren't good ones.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nI'm sorry, Gregory. I do understand that you\nare a different person.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018	It's just that, well...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nIt's OK. You don't need to explain. I'm making\nyou uncomfortable. We can talk another time.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020	I'm just grateful I was able to see your face and\nhear your voice. Please, don't worry about it.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021	I'll see you around, Lady Veyle.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nHe looks just like Griss...but they couldn't be\nmore different. I should try to be friendlier.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08ヴェイル\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nグレゴリー\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nLady Veyle, I wanted to make up for our last\nencounter. I brought you a gift.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nA gift? Thank you, Gregory. What is it?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nWell, I asked around and was told that you like\nspicy things, so...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	I went into town and got you the spiciest treats\nI could find. Shall we try them together?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nYou really went to all that trouble for me?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nIf it's worth doing something, it's worth doing\nit right. Please, if something looks tasty, dig in!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\n...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	He's always so kind. And yet...although I know\nhe isn't Griss, I'm still nervous around him.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nHm? What's wrong? Do you feel awkward\neating alone?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	All right, then. I'll eat something too. This\nbright-red sandwich thing looks pretty good.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nCareful! That one looks extremely spicy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nHm, not as spicy as I thought! Although, wait...\nOh no. Is this a delayed heat?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	AAAH! H-hot, hot! Aaah!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nOh no! I'll get you some water!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\n*cough* I'm fine. Really! *cough* Don't worry\nabout me. Please. Try one of the treats.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nA-are you sure? Well, if you insist...I guess I'll\ntry the same one.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	Oh wow, this is delicious! I've never had this\nbefore, but it's just spicy enough.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nSeriously? This isn't too spicy for you? Wow...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	I'm glad I made you smile, at least. There's still\nplenty left. *cough* Please help yourself.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nUm... You're sweating. Are you feeling OK?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nThat might have been a bit too spicy. Guess I'm\nnot as tolerant to that sort of pain as you, heh...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	But I'm fine... Really... I can handle...\x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nI still wanted to apologize. To make up for it,\nI brought some different treats for us to try.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nAre these all spicy things? You tailored these\nto my tastes again, didn't you?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	I appreciate the gesture, but if you can't eat\nthem with me...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nDon't you worry. I've been practicing.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nEven so...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nC'mon, let's eat.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	Hmm, this bright-red cookie smells pretty good.\nOr should I try... No, I'll take this one.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nTake it slow, OK? I've seen how you handle\nspicy foods.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nNo, I've got this. I can handle spice─really!\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	Maybe I'll try this cake next... Though, whoa!\nIt definitely smells like it packs a punch.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nWhy are you putting yourself through this?\nI hope it's not just for my sake.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nWell, nobody likes being afraid, right?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nI don't follow...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nI know that you're scared of me. Just looking\nat me makes you shudder.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	I don't like being scared, so the last thing I want\nto do is make you feel that way.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	I know that other me hurt you, but I'm not your\nenemy, and I wouldn't ever scare or harm you.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	I thought that this could be a way to prove that\nto you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nI...I see. I think.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nIf eating this food together makes you happy,\nthen it's worth it. I'll get used to the burning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	But...it scares me when you push yourself like\nthat for my sake. I worry you'll faint again.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nReally?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nNext time, if you want to bring me a gift, it\nshould be something we both enjoy.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026	I want us to be friends, but that doesn't mean\ndoing things that make us uncomfortable.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027	Unless you don't want to be friends...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nグレゴリー\nNo. I mean, yes! I want to be your friend, if you\nare comfortable with that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nThank you!\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030	On that note, what's a food you really like?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
