MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#001	Hey, good morning! You probably heard me\ntalking to myself.\x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#002	You asked me not to go out of my way, so I'm\nnot going to.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#003	I don't want to cause you any trouble.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#001	Did I do a good job?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#002	I'm glad. But if you do want a big breakfast...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
