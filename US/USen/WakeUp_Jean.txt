MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#001	This is a really beautiful room.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#002	I've got to be careful not to drop this potion.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#003	If it stained, I don't know what I'dâ”€ Ah!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#001	Oh! I almost dropped this potion on you!\x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#003	I'm really sorry I woke you up like that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#001	I heard the Divine Dragon won't wake up...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#002	So much sleep might hint at a medical issue.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#001	Good morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#002	You look healthy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#001	Hmm, doesn't look injured, or ill...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#002	But you can't see most illnesses from\nthe outside.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#003	The Divine Dragon is so important, it's easy\nto worry.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#001	You're awake.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#002	Do you feel healthy? \x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#003	That's good.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#004	If you ever feel lousy, call me. Immediately.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#001	Waking up the Divine Dragon...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#002	gives me a chance for a checkup.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#001	You woke up quickly this morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#002	Your color's good, eyes focused, bed head\nminimal. Very healthy!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#003	And as long as you're healthy, I'm happy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#001	Divine One?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#002	Hmm... Not waking up quickly.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#003	Must be really tired.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#004	I'll make some tea to help with recovery\nfrom fatigue.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#001	Oh, you're awake, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#002	You've been working hard lately.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#003	I'll make you some delicious tea. It's a specialty\nfrom my hometown...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#004	so just relax while I brew it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#001	Pretty good harvest of medicinal herbs\nthis morning...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#001	Sorry my wake up was late today.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#002	But herbs picked at dawn are more effective.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#003	So I wanted to gather them.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#004	Would you like some?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#001	Herbs that are good for the skin, or help eyes\nto focus, or keep hair colorful...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#002	There's even some to help you get more rest...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#003	Hmm, what would happen if I administered\nthose to the Divine Dragon?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#001	I wasn't doing anything! At all!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#002	Good morning, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#003	Ooo, really nice weather we're having, huh?\nWell...anyway!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#001	Divine One, there's something I want to talk\nto you about regarding herbs. Oh, asleep, eh?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#001	Sorry for waking you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#002	I was off to get hold of a new medicine.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#003	So I thought I'd ask...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#004	if there was anything you wanted while\nI was out.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#001	This new potion comes in five flavors.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#002	There's sweet, sour, bitter, salty-sweet...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#003	And the last one is...salty. Why salty?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#001	Hey, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#002	What flavor would you like for my next potion?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#003	I always prefer sweet, so I figured you...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#004	Oh... Salty? Really?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#001	Divine One, how is your injury from before?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#001	I've come to examine your injury...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#002	from when you were picking herbs for me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#003	It looks to be healing nicely. Good.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#004	Thank you so much for helping me out.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#001	There's not even a scar...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#002	I'm relieved, but I'll still need to make sure you\ndon't push yourself too hard again.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#003	I'll see what I can do.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#001	Remember those medicinal herbs you picked?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#002	My parents wrote to say they were really useful\nto the village.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#003	They said to thank you too.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#001	Divine One, it's morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#002	Thank you for your faith in me, and for trusting\nme to help.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#001	Good morning. Even coming here to wake you...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#002	feels totally different from before.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#003	Your offer of the Pact Ring made me very happy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#004	I'm really proud I have your trust.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#001	The Pact Ring makes me so happy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#002	Putting all this trust in me, even though I'm\nstill young.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#003	It makes me want to show you how much I\ncan accomplish.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#004	I'll become a doctor, and save people's lives,\nand...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#005	make it so everyone you love...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#006	will live for a hundred years.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#001	Did you hear me just now?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#002	Of course I'm planning on living even longer\nthan a hundred years.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#003	So I hope we'll still see each other...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#004	even when I'm an old grandpa.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#001	I heard you were injured. Where? Show me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#001	Oh, I see.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#002	I'm glad you're not hurt.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#003	I brought a lot of different medicines with me,\njust in case.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#004	But not having to use them on you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#005	Huge relief.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#001	Ah, fast asleep.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#002	Phew, I'm glad it was just a misunderstanding.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#003	Still, it's really good that everyone comes to me\nabout the Divine Dragon's health.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#004	Oh... I wonder if that means they all know\nabout the Pact Ring?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#005	I never bragged, not even once...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#006	But it's pretty great to know other people\nnoticed my work for the Divine Dragon.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#001	Good morning. Did you sleep well?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#002	Ah, that's good.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#003	As long as you always get a good night's sleep...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#004	and keep on being healthy...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
