MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nマデリーン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThanks for training with me, Madeline.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nNo, thank you. It was an honor to spar with\nsomeone of your talents.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	Actually, may I say something? Before we\npart ways.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOf course. What is it?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nI just want to say how much I admire you.\nYou're so earnest and optimistic.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	Not to mention how graciously you accepted\nthose of us from another world.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	What sets you apart as a leader is not your\nDivine Dragon roots, but your kind heart.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOh! I appreciate your kindness, but that's quite\na few compliments to throw my way at once.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	For what it's worth, you're incredible too.\nYou're loyal and fearless in battle.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	I'm grateful that you came to our world.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nPlease. It is a knight's role to charge bravely\ninto battle.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	I don't need praise for doing my duty. After all,\nit's not the recognition that matters.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	It's the fact that I am serving my purpose and\nhelping you secure victory.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThat's very reassuring to hear.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nNow, I must be off to my next engagement.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	If ever you're short a sparring partner, feel free\nto call on me again.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nマデリーン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nOne quick strike and it'll be done with! I just\nneed to get closer... Eh!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nMadeline, your weapon's drawn! What's\nthe matter?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	Oh, a ladybug! Cute.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nCute? That creature is trespassing in\nthe Somniel!\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	I have to eliminate it, or it could rain destruction\non you and all our allies!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nUh-huh. I take it you're scared of bugs.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nI didn't say that! A knight never admits fear,\nno matter how strong the foe!\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	Ugh... But fine, yes. I have something of an...\naversion to insects.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThat's OK. Everyone has things that scare them.\nBut how about you put away your weapon?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	That bug isn't going to hurt you. I promise.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nHow can you be so sure?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHere, watch. Shoo! Shoo!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nAAAH! The beast is on the move!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIt's all right. Look, it's flying outside.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nYou let it escape... What if it goes on a\nmurderous rampage?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI think that's unlikely. Besides, it's best to settle\nmatters without violence when possible.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nHm... I can see the sense in that. Thank you\nfor handling the situation.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nNo problem. I'll say, I'm kind of surprised to\nsee you like this.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	You're so brave in battle. Who'd have guessed a\nbug could make you squirm?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nSquirm? Knights don't squirm! Please, wipe that\ngrin off your face!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nマデリーン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nTime for a break, Divine One?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'd say so. Thanks for training with me\nagain, Madeline.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nMy pleasure. Really, I appreciate any chance to\nget my body up and moving.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIs something wrong?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nNot at all. Actually, I was thinking about how\nglad I am to be here in your world.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	I'd be lying if I said I had no doubts or\nlingering regrets.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	But being here with you, I feel as if I'm\nbecoming the knight I was meant to be.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'm happy to hear you say that.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	Still...I'm sorry for asking you to leave your\nown world.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nPlease don't apologize. Since coming here,\nI've grown so much, and now...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	Ah!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nA bug! Don't worry, Madeline. I'll take care of it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nNo... I've got this.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	I can do this, I can do this... Eeek...\nNow, shoo! Shoo!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nNice! You handled that well.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nHah... I was scared...really scared...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	But not as much as last time, and that counts\nfor something.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	I'm glad to be here, learning to overcome my\nweaknesses with allies I adore and respect.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	If I hadn't come to this world, I doubt I would\nhave grown so much.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	That's what I meant to say earlier. In short,\nthank you, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThank you for being such a good knight.\nAnd sparring partner.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nHm-hm! Yes. I'll always strive to excel at both.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI don't doubt it for a second.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nマデリーン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nMadeline, you're up pretty late.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nDivine One, hello. Yes... I was having\ntrouble sleeping.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'm sorry to hear that. Is there something on\nyour mind?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004	Not to pry at all, but if I'm feeling upset, I find\nit helps to get it off my chest.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nYes, I suppose you're right.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006	You see... I can't stop thinking about Mauvier.\nThe one from my world, that is.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nAh... Right.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nIt's not that I regret coming here. I don't.\nBut I can't help but feel like I failed him.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009	I wish I had noticed the Warp staff sooner...\nI wish I had been stronger.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010	Maybe then he'd still be alive, living here with\nall of us.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011	These are the thoughts that plague me at night\nwhen I'm trying to sleep.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nMadeline...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nI'm sorry. Ignore me. I know it's unproductive\nto think such things.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nMaybe so. But I know how you feel. I have\nregrets about what happened to my mother.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015	The more I try to stop those thoughts, the more\nforcefully they come rushing in.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016	It's OK, though. When you're having a hard\ntime, you can come talk to me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nI appreciate the gesture, but this is hardly as\nsimple as inviting you to spar with me.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018	You're the Divine Dragon, and I'm a knight.\nI can't ask you to share my burdens.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nPerhaps you'd feel differently if you weren't\njust a knight...but my knight.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nP-pardon?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'm sorry. It seems abrupt, I know. But I've\nactually been considering it for some time.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022	You're diligent, brave, dependable... Who better\nto serve as my right hand?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023	And this way, I'll be better able to support you\nas well. So, please... Take this.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nThe Pact Ring! But, Divine One...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI know that Mauvier will always be special\nto you. I don't want that to change.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026	Your loyalty to him is enduring, and I would\nnever ask you to lose hold of that.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027	I'm giving you this ring to show that you're as\nimportant to me as he is to you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#028	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nOh...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#029	I can't begin to express how happy this all\nmakes me feel.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#030	But...can I really accept this offer?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#031	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOnly you can answer that question.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#032	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nYou're right...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#033	Mauvier said that he wanted me to be happy.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#034	If he's watching over me right now, I'm sure\nhe will accept whatever choice I make.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#035	And so...Divine One.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#036	Yes, I will accept this ring and serve as\nyour knight!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#037	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThank you, Madeline. Together, we can face the\nfuture without fear.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#038	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nYes. And I promise to be a knight worthy of\nthis honor.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#039	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nTo grow ever stronger, that I may protect you\nand ensure long, happy lives for us both.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
