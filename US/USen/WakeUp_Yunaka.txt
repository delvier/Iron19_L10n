MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#002	It was my turn to wake you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#003	So...mission accomplished!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#001	Not gonna make this easy, huh?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#002	OK. Let's get serious.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#003	Time to break out my rooster impression!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#004	Caw-caw-doodle-do!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#001	Hi!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#002	Hehe, what?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#003	That's ridiculous. Of course there aren't any\nroosters in here.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#004	Maybe you dreamed it?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#001	Surprise, Divine One! It's Yunaka!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#001	Up and at 'em!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#002	Feeling rested?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#003	Well, my work here is done...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#004	so...have a good one! See ya!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#001	Hmm...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#002	Maybe I'm too easygoing.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#003	Let's try someone more strict. Ahem...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#004	"Divine One! You must wake at once!"\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#001	Aha!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#002	So you get up right away for Sir Vander...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#003	But you snooze right through Yunaka?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#004	I see how it is!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#001	I wonder what's in the Divine Dragon's room...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#002	Let's get sneaky!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#001	Ah! You're awake?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#002	I, uh, I took a wrong turn! You know me,\nalways...getting lost.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#003	I'll get out of your hair.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#001	Fancy decor, sacred altar...just what you'd\nexpect so far.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#002	All this stuff's so nice, though.\nOoo, what's this?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#003	Didn't think I'd find a musical instrument in\nhere. Should I give it a try?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#001	Morning!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#002	Do you like music?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#003	You know...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#004	I play a little myself.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#005	Maybe I'll show you sometime.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#001	Haah... I've gotta stop lying all the time.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#002	What an awful habit...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#001	Ah! Was I too loud?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#002	I'm sorry─I didn't mean to wake you so soon.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#003	I can fix this. One little bump on the noggin...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#004	and you'll be back asleep in no time.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#001	I gabbed at someone for an hour yesterday\nabout my dog.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#002	I've never had a dog! I'm a cat person!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#003	So now I gotta remember who I told about the\ndog, what its name is, keep my story straight...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#001	I've made up my mind, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#002	I'm going to work on being more honest.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#003	Starting with the small, pointless lies. No more\nbad habits.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#001	Fast asleep, I see.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#002	It doesn't look like anything could wake you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#001	Wow, I was wrong!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#002	You're a light sleeper after all. I'm impressed.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#003	Guess we don't have to worry about any thugs\ngetting the jump on you!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#001	Ah... Hello, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#002	I worry about you. Someone could just walk\nright in here.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#003	And if that someone had my set of skills...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#004	it would be all too easy to take your life.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#001	Oh! Morning, Divine One!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#002	Huh? You heard a stranger's voice?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#003	There's no one else here.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#004	Maybe you imagined it?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#001	Divine One! Hey, Divine One!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#002	I've got something to─ Oh, you're asleep.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#001	No, no!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#002	It's silly. Don't worry about it─go back to sleep.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#003	What? You're staying up...just to chat with me?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#004	That's really nice. Thank you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#001	I was gonna tell you all about this dagger\nI found at the market.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#002	Full flat grind, polished steel like you've\nnever seen...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#003	A vintage fishtail pommel and a point to take\nyour eye out!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#001	And you wouldn't believe the scabbard on\nthis thing.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#002	The engravings alone are pure art...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#003	Oh─ Hey, how long have you been awake?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#001	Zappy! Only me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#002	Sorry your partner's not more glamorous.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#001	Hehe, flew out of bed the second I came\nalong, didn't you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#002	I don't want to assume anything, but...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#003	Were you excited to see me?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#001	Hehe, you're fierce on the battlefield, but\nyou sleep like a little kitten.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#002	It's weird, being with you...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#003	Since you accept all of me, past and present...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#004	For the first time in my life, I feel whole.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#005	Is this what it's like to be accepted for who I\ntruly am?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#006	Thank you for showing me. I never would\nhave known.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#001	Huh? I'm different than usual?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#002	Maybe you're right. But if that's true...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#003	It's because I'm holding nothing back.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#004	Whatever else I am, I'll always be your partner.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#001	Hehe! Ready or not, here I come!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#001	Found you! Not that it was hard.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#002	I'm usually the one hiding.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#003	But with you, I don't have to hide anymore.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#004	Thank you for letting me be my truest self.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#001	Still asleep? You're bad at this game.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#002	That's what I like about you, though.\nYou never hide.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#003	The more time we spend together, fighting\nback to back...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#004	the more I feel that honesty of yours rubbing off\non me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#005	I'm so grateful to you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#006	Now that I've come to terms with my past, I can\nfinally look forward to the future.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#001	I have a new secret for you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#002	I'm enjoying life so much more now.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#003	But what I like most of all...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#004	is spending time with you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
