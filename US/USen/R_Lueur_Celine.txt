MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08セリーヌ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI really enjoyed our tea party today. Thanks for\ninviting me, Céline.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nThe pleasure is all mine, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nOur conversation made for an excellent spice\nover an already fine tea.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThe tea was fine, wasn't it? That floral note it\nhad was almost unbelievably good.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nI'm glad you appreciated it. The leaves were\ngrown in Firene, you know.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nThe delicate, subtle taste embodies the spirit\nof our kingdom.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nIt is my utmost favorite.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYeah, I've heard the Firenese prefer the pastoral\nlife over any kind of open conflict.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThat really came through in this tea.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nThere's a Firenese folktale I think you might\nfind interesting.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nOur royal palace is home to a spirit who\nensures happiness for the virtuous.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nFor thieves or interlopers, however, the spirit\ndrives them off with mischievous tricks.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nHahaha, imagine! Driven off by the prankish\nantics of a spirit!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nNo serious consequences at all. How effective a\ndeterrent do you suppose such a spirit really is?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nEven so, it's a lovely story.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIt's the kind of goodhearted tale that reflects\nthe Firenese character, I think.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nYes... Yes, it is. Well then, we must have tea\ntogether again sometime, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08セリーヌ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou're looking a bit grim, Céline. Problems?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nAh, Divine One. Do you remember the tea we\nenjoyed together the other day?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIt was so good that I'm not likely to forget it\nanytime soon.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nIt would appear that shipments of those leaves\nare becoming a favorite target for highwaymen.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nChanging the trade routes has made little\ndifference. Each day brings more victims.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThat's awful.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nI am not often called on to intervene directly in\nmatters such as these.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nBut this is an emergency, and no one in Firene\nknows more of tea than I.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nSo Mother has requested that I handle the\nproblem personally.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHow do you feel about that?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nI suspect it may be part of my education.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nEven if my brother is first in line for the throne,\nI am still princess of Firene.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nSo what's your plan for dealing with them?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nI thought I might drive them off with pranks.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nAh, wouldn't it be lovely if things were as\nsimple as they are in folktales?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nBut real life isn't so...pastoral.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nNo, it's not.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nI will show no mercy to anyone who causes\nsuffering to the people of Firene.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nAnd I will go to any lengths so that my people\nmay enjoy the peace they are accustomed to.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nDon't look at me like that, Divine One. This is a\nduty I must bear.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nNow then, please excuse me. Action must\nbe taken in this matter...swiftly.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08セリーヌ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nIf I worried you the other day, Divine One,\nI sincerely apologize.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWhat happened to the highwaymen attacking\nthose tea shipments?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nWe supplied funds to heighten the caravan's\nsecurity.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nThen they let the thieves escape, which led our\nnew security forces directly to their stronghold.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nI just came from giving the order to eliminate\ntheir base.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI see.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nThey are bandits, but they are still Firenese,\nand I have now signed their death warrant.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nI would do it again without hesitation.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nNo one─not one soul─can be suffered to\nviolate Firene's peace.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nBut it must have been a painful choice.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nIt wasn't.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nAnguish is one of the few privileges not\nafforded to those in my position.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHmm... I know you have to harden your heart,\nbut you have a heart all the same.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nYour empathy is appreciated.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nThere is nothing I would not do to protect\nmy kingdom.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nI would draw my blade for peace without\nhesitation. I have steeled myself for it all my life.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nEven so...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nI find no satisfaction in what must be done.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nI worry that is a mark of weakness in me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThat's not weakness. It's kindness.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIt's the same kindness that's reflected in the\nFirenese character.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nYou are most generous, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08セリーヌ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nDivine One, might I have a word?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOf course, Céline.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nIt concerns a matter we spoke of previously.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nI told you that I would not hesitate to draw my\nblade for the sake of my nation.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nThat to bring peace to my people, I would\nwage war.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYes, I remember.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nYet now I find my resolve wavering.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nI wonder whether I could truly be so merciless\nin the pursuit of peace.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThat's understandable for someone so kind\nas you, Céline.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nIt is not kindness! It is a sort of...cowardice.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nThe unique cowardice that comes of what\nothers may think. I fear that you would hate me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOh...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nTherefore I ask that you hold me in contempt.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nScorn me for putting my personal feelings\nahead of my royal duties.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nIf I already bore your disappointment, I could\nagain be merciless for the sake of my people.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI think you should have this, Céline.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nIs this...the Pact Ring?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou could never disappoint me. I'll always be\nthere to support you, whatever you decide.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWhether it's for the kingdom of Firene or for\nyourself. Whatever your motivations...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI will stand by you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nThen...you see nothing to loathe in my\nsteel heart?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nNo. I know there's more to your heart than that.\nWhatever decisions you feel you have to make...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWe can work through the consequences\ntogether. You don't have to be alone.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nThank you, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nWith you at my side, what reason would I have\nfor cowardice?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nI should find only joy instead.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#028	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nDivine One, your unwavering support has lifted\na great weight from me. You are a true friend.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
