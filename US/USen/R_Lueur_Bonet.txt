MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nOh, and that one, a blueberry.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nUm, thanks? I think... You did mean those as\ncompliments, right?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nOf course.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nTomatoes and blueberries are among the most\nprecious treasures that nature gives us.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nI am steeped in culinary traditions from all over\nthe world, ergo my penchant for food analogies.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nAh...so inspiring...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI guess it makes sense that a chef would see the\nworld in terms of ingredients.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThank you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nNo, no. It is I who should be thanking you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nFor allowing me to find inspiration in your\ntomato and blueberry eyes.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHow impressive, Bunet─to know about so\nmany dishes from around the world.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nI have much more to learn! And inspiration\nstrikes me in many unexpected ways.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nI aspire to experience every flavor inspiration\nand to create new recipes for people to enjoy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWow, I look forward to seeing you do that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nA chef must always be up for a culinary\njourney, wherever it may go.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0A\x04ボネ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nHm... What is that aroma?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI don't smell anything.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nIt's you. You're emitting a scent that I do\nnot recognize.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOh, that! I got some sauce on a bit of clothing\nat lunch.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIt was such a small amount, I didn't think\nanyone would notice. Sorry, I'll go change.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nNo, no. Please allow me to find inspiration in\nthis curious scent.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOh!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nThis must be from a dish I'm not familiar with.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nMight I ask you for a quick lick? I am not\nfamiliar with this dish you ate.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou want to taste the sauce? On my...clothing?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOh, I know! Why don't we speak with the\nperson who's on meal duty?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nI'd love to know sooner than that. It's my\nculinary curiosity, you see.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nStill, my clothing?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nI've been thinking about cooking, ingredients,\nand flavors for as long as I can remember.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nAnd over the years, I've diligently added to my\nculinary vocabulary. Can you help?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI know I said I was excited about your ambitions\nas a chef. But this one's a no.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI support your finding inspiration, but there\nare limits.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nBesides, there's more to great cooking than\nknowing all the flavors.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nI don't understand.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou'll figure it out. In the meantime, I'm going\nto go change. Excuse me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nWhat could the Divine Dragon have meant\nby that?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0A\x04ボネ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nDivine One. I owe you an apology for my\nrudeness the other day.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWe talked through it. And I got my clothing\nwashed─all fine.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nYes, but what you told me─that there is more\nto great cooking than knowing all the flavors...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nI dove back into my culinary training to better\nunderstand what you meant─what I'm missing.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou did?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nYes. After we spoke, I retreated to the kitchen\nand have been cooking all this time.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nI worked from morning to night to cook up\na dish inspired by that sauce stain.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWow. All this because I spilled something\non my clothes.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nStill I could not find an answer. And as I verged\non despair, a thought came to mind.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\n"How about instead of worrying about this,\nI make food the Divine One would enjoy?"\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nSo that's what I did. And the taste of the\nresulting dish far exceeded my expectations.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nThat's the secret to great cooking, isn't it?\nCaring for the people you're cooking for.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nAbsolutely! I completely agree.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIt's about caring for people─not knowing every\nflavor and recipe under the sun.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nDivine One, I'm sorry that I made\nyou uncomfortable.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIt's OK. I still support you, even if I had to draw\nthe line.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI have no doubt that one day, you will be the\nworld's best chef.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nThank you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_RELIANCE_S_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0A\x04ボネ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nDivine One, I have created an entirely new dish.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nIf you would, please try it. I'd love to hear\nyour thoughts.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIt certainly looks delicious. The colors are\nbeautiful.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nThe tomatoes and blueberries you see there,\nthey were inspired by your beautiful eyes.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nEnjoy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nAll right. Thank you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThis is...incredible! It's better than anything\nI've ever tasted!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nI am pleased to hear it. I was determined to\nmake this dish something extraordinary for you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nWhen I cook with you in mind, the food tastes...\ntranscendent. I would like to do so more often.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nThat is, I would like to cook with you in\nmind...forever...if it pleased you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nDo you mean...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nI mean, I would like to be your partner,\nDivine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nIf you found the food I made for you pleasing,\nthat is.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nBut if it's inconvenient, I'll remember this dish\nfondly and return to my chef's duties.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOh... No.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThat doesn't sound good at all. Please, stay. I'd\nlike you to make more incredible dishes for me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nActually, Bunet, even if you didn't cook me a\nsingle meal, I'd want you to stay.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
