MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08セリーヌ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ジャン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nI must thank you, Jean.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nPrincess Céline? What are you thanking me for?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nThe tea produced in your hometown is far and\naway my favorite.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nThere is joy in each and every sip. So I thought\nit appropriate to thank you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nAh. In that case, I should thank you too.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nMy mother will be over the moon to find out\nyou like it so much.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nYour mother?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nShe works at a tea shop back home.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nYou've probably had tea brewed from leaves\nthat my mother processed.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nI see! Do pass on my thanks, then.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nI will. Praise from Your Highness would be\nthe pride of a lifetime for my mother.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nWould you like to join me for tea sometime?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nWe can brew some tea leaves from your home\nand drink to your mother's health.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nOh! I've done nothing to deserve such an\ninvitation, but I'm grateful anyway.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nI'll be looking forward to it!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nAs shall I. You'll be hearing from me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08セリーヌ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ジャン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nHello, Jean.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nHello, Princess Céline!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nOh, is that a medical text? I'm not interrupting\nyour studies, I hope.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nDon't worry about it. I'm just reading up so\nI can be a good doctor.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nHow exemplary. Perhaps another day, then.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nHmm? Oh, you mean for that teatime?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nYes. A batch of tea from your home arrived,\nso I wondered if today would suit you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nBut your studies are more important.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nI'm very sorry. But thanks for thinking of me!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nTeatime is postponed, not canceled, dear.\nOur anticipation shall make it all the sweeter.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nMy hometown's tea must really be amazing.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nHaha, you're just realizing this now?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nThe tea grown in your hometown is nonpareil,\nI assure you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nGosh!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nHave you never considered a future in tea?\nTaking up your mother's trade, so to speak.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nNot really. I like tea, but it can't save lives.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nIt can't...save lives?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nHm? Princess Céline?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nI'm sorry, it's nothing. You have studying to do.\nI shall take my leave and my leaves.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nWell, thank you. I was just at a really fascinating\npart of this text!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nBe diligent, but don't push yourself beyond\nyour limits.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ジャン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nUgh... It's just not sinking in.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08セリーヌ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nHello, Jean. You appear to be hard at work\nwith your studies.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nPrincess Céline!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nI've read this chapter over and over, and I'm\njust not getting it. My brain is too tired.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nI know what you need. Here.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nIs that smell...my hometown tea?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nIt is indeed.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nI saw you struggling with your studies and\njudged that you were in need of a break.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nWow. Thanks, Princess Céline!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nMmm, this smell... It's so relaxing. It reminds me\na lot of home.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nNow, Jean. You mentioned once that you didn't\nbelieve tea could save lives.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nBut I say to you that your hometown tea has\nsaved me too many times to count.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nTea...saved you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nWhen things aren't going well and I'm in low\nspirits...that's a sign that it's teatime.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nA hot cup of tea in these situations does much\nto lift my mood.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nThings tend to go better afterward, even if it's\nonly because I've cleared my head.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nWhen the problems I'm dealing with are severe,\nis it an exaggeration to say that tea saves me?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nNo. I suppose it isn't.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nIn fact, my own spirits feel pretty lifted now!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nThank you, Princess Céline. I learned something\nvaluable today, and it wasn't from this book.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nI guess, medically speaking, I can't count out\nthe healing power of tea. Sorry about that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nYou have nothing to apologize for. I'm relieved\nto hear your mood has improved.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nWhen I get home and see my mother, I'm going\nto tell her that our tea is the best in the world.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nIf she doubts you, I shall visit in person to\ninform her that her tea always brings me joy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nActually, if it's OK with Your Highness, could\nwe have our teatime now?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nDrinking tea alone's no fun, and besides...\nI want to talk to Your Highness a little more.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nI'll get right back to studying when we're done,\nof course!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nHahaha, nothing would make me happier.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nTo be honest, I was in the mood for some tea\nas well. I apologize for speaking out of turn.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セリーヌ\nWell then, shall we retire to the tea room?\nThere's so much more about tea to discuss!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nLead the way!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
