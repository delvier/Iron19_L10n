MID_WU_C_1_IN_#001	We decided to take turns waking you from\nyour slumber, Divine One.
MID_WU_C_1_IN_#002	Today, the duty falls to me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#001	It's good to see you rising so promptly.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#002	A fine morning, is it not?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#001	How soundly you sleep...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#002	I hesitate to wake you needlessly.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#003	Alas, such is my duty as a steward.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#004	Divine One... Ahem, it's best you start\ngetting up.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#001	Good morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#002	That I might be the one to wake you...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#003	is indeed an honor.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#001	It is I, Vander, 32nd Steward of the Dragon.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#002	Oh...are you resting?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#001	Good morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#002	As always, I shall endeavor to tend to all\nof your needs.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#001	Hmm. What would be the most pleasant\nwake up experience?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#002	Perhaps if I deliver breakfast each morning?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#001	Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#002	For reference, what manner of food would you\nenjoy upon waking?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#001	Divine One, please do forgive my intrusion.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#001	I see you are finding time to rest.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#002	Excellent choice. Rest focuses the mind.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#001	You expressed a certain sense of guilt for\ntroubling me, but I say...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#002	There is no greater pleasure than to serve.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#003	Ah, forgive me. Perhaps I am pushing my\nservice upon you again.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#001	Ah, you are awake?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#002	Well then, I shall take my leave.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#003	Many thanks for your resolute patrol\nof the Somniel.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#001	Until such time as you awake...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#002	I shall attend to maintenance of the altar.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#001	Oh my. You are quick to rise today.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#002	I should have arrived sooner...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#003	I beg you to pardon my carelessness.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#001	Ah, cleaning the altar like this...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#002	It brings back a number of happy memories.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#003	When Queen Lumera would visit...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#004	she would gaze longingly at your\nsleeping face...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#001	Ah, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#002	How are you feeling today?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#003	We are having absolutely lovely weather.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#001	Divine One, we must speak about the\nupcoming battle if─\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#002	Ah. I see you are resting.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#001	I am quite sorry for waking you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#002	Though you do wake up easier now.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#003	Hm-hm. I must say, it brings a smile to my face.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#001	You have been working tirelessly of late.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#002	Keep pushing yourself and one day...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#003	you will become a magnificent ruler, the same\nas Queen Lumera.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#001	You heard me speaking?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#002	Think nothing of it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#003	I am, as ever, at your disposal.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#001	I have arrived slightly earlier than usual.\nHow do you fare?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#001	Good morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#002	Please, take your time rising. I have no wish\nto rush you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#001	I will be outside knitting until you need me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#002	I would like to show you what I'm working on,\nbut wonder if you'll like it...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#001	I had thought to leave...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#002	but I see I have roused you. Apologies.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#003	By the way, do you happen to like knitting?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#001	Divine One. It is I, Vander.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#002	May I have a quick word with─\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#003	Hah, you are sleeping.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#001	Oh? You were only pretending to sleep?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#002	So we're close enough now...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#003	that you engage in mischief?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#001	I treasure your Pact Ring, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#002	In it, I sense the power of Queen Lumera...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#003	and of yourself.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#004	By my oath, I will repay the honor...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#005	that you have bestowed upon me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#006	I am your steadfast knight, eternally.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#001	You have awakened, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#002	I thought perhaps I might chat with you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#003	I do enjoy our talks so.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#001	Sorry to disturb you, but it is time to get up.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#001	I am pleased to see you wake so quickly...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#002	as it means we can spend a little time together.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#001	I suspect, besides the Emblems, it is I who sees\nyour sleeping face the most.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#002	The day will come when I will entrust your care\nto the next generation of stewards...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#003	Still, as the 32nd Steward of the Dragon... No...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#004	As Vander...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#005	I pray you find a place in your heart to always\nremember me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#001	Good morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#002	You say you heard something?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#003	Perhaps it was a dream.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#004	Or else the mere ramblings of an old man who\nthinks the world of you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
