MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08ゼルコバ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ユナカ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nUgh, I'm not interested in playing your goofy\ngame, Zelkov. Just tell me what you're after.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ゼルコバ\nWhy, Yunaka, what *game* do you think\nI am playing?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nThe stalking game, by the look of it. Don't act\nlike you don't know the rulebook backwards!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ゼルコバ\nSo you've noticed, have you? How *curious.*\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ゼルコバ\nYou have the perceptive powers of a *hunter.*\nDo you perchance hunt for sport...or for money?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ゼルコバ\nAt last, the truth is *written* on your face. I'd\nsuspected you made your trade in violence.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ゼルコバ\nThat is why I've *stalked* you, as you put it.\nSuspicious persons ought to be observed.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nOK, I'll admit it. You've got some chops.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nNow, what say we rattle your brains around\na bit and see what shakes out?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ゼルコバ\nOh my. Be gentle.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nYou've got the same killer instinct I do.\nIt practically oozes from your pores. Like slime!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nSo, tell me. Have we had similar careers?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ゼルコバ\nThat does *appear* to be the case.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nGreat. Well, let's not speak of it again, OK?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nMy work is in the past. I'm happily retired.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ゼルコバ\nI, too, have washed my *hands* of that life.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nSo we have that in common too, huh? Well, let's\nnot make a thing of it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nLook, here's me not making a thing. See ya.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08ゼルコバ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ユナカ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ゼルコバ\nAbout what we discussed *previously,*\nYunaka...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nThat's so weird! I told you not to make a thing\nof it, and yet here you are. Making things.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ゼルコバ\nThat message was well received. I only wished\nto discuss *one* more detail.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ゼルコバ\nYou said that a killer instinct *oozes* from my\npores. I believe you used the word "slime."\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ゼルコバ\nWhat did you mean by that?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ゼルコバ\nPlease. It is crucial to my *well-being* that I am\nable to curate the image I present to others.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nFine.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nLook. You're a hunter. Everything you do and\nsay is about the kill.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ゼルコバ\nCould you indulge me with an *example*?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nOK, sure. Take your eyes, for *example.*\nThey're ice cold. Calculating.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nNormal people don't go around evaluating what\nfolks' lives are worth. That's an assassin thing.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nYou're always probing for weaknesses too.\nConsidering vectors of attack, right?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ゼルコバ\nThat is *not* what I...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nSeriously, bud? You're doing it right now!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nLook at yourself. Tell me you're not poised to\ncounter a knife thrust from my dominant hand.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nYou're constantly positioning to maximize your\ntactical advantage. Don't think I don't see it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ゼルコバ\nPerceptive...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nRegular people don't think about violence so\nmuch in everyday life. That's what I meant.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ゼルコバ\nTo think that I should be so *transparent*\nto you...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nSharp eyes were part of the old job, as I'm sure\nyou know.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ゼルコバ\nI appreciate your insightful analysis. I will\n*reflect* on what you've said.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nYeah, don't mention it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08ゼルコバ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ユナカ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nHeya, Zelkov. Would you mind if we talked\na teensy bit more about our trade?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ゼルコバ\nWhy the sudden change of *heart*? You were\nquite clear that you didn't wish to discuss it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nYeah, yeah. I know what I said. I was there the\nwhole time.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nI was worried talking about it too much would\nbe...too much. But it hasn't been.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nThe opposite, actually. Talking about it's helped\nme get distance. Perspective, y'know?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ゼルコバ\nCare to elaborate?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nLook, people like us don't often get the chance\nto speak candidly. It could be a good thing.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ゼルコバ\nPerhaps you're right. But even so, what is left\nfor us to *converse* about, exactly?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ゼルコバ\nThe story of how I came to such a profession\nis not one I am *keen* to tell.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ゼルコバ\nI'm afraid it's a rather tragic tale. Ill-suited for\nany sort of *pleasant* conversation.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nYeah. Honestly, that whole chapter of my life\nwas pretty dang awful.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ゼルコバ\nIt was the same for me. Not even the most\ndifficult *challenges* we face today compare.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ゼルコバ\nBut I would venture to suppose that you did\nnot *choose* to embark upon a life of killing.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nWhat makes you say that?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ゼルコバ\nI get the sense, merely by observing, that you\ngenuinely have *no* regrets.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ゼルコバ\nFrom this observation I inferred you may not\nhave been *responsible* for your circumstances.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nGood inference...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ゼルコバ\nMoreover, your present self was formed as a\n*result* of growing apart from your past.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ゼルコバ\nIn a way, then...if you are the blossom, your\npast is the fertilizer which *nourished* you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nThat's...really insightful, actually. Thanks.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nWords have weight, Zelkov, and every one\nof yours is big and heavy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nBut it's funny. Hearing them somehow makes\nme feel lighter. Maybe it's our common bond.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ゼルコバ\nYou flatter me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nI've been thinking about what I'll do when all\nthis is over. When the world's finally peaceful.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nWhat I want most is to go someplace where\nI can kick back. Put my feet up. Luxuriate!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ゼルコバ\nI will say that does *sound* lovely.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nIf and when that happens, I hope you'll drop in\non me once in a while.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ゼルコバ\nI would gladly make an appearance. There will\nbe conversations *only* you and I can have.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nOoo, yes! Love it! We'll do each other's hair,\ntrade weapon factoids. Whatever we want!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ゼルコバ\nIndeed... Let us work toward that eventuality\nas our *common* goal from now on.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nIt's a promise, then. If we've got the same dark\npast, we may as well share a bright future.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
