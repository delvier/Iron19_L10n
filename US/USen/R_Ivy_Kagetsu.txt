MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08アイビー\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06カゲツ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nYes, I see it! Princess Ivy, dinner tonight shall\nbe...bum-bum-ba-BA! Vegetable stir-fry!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アイビー\nI see.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nYour response is very underwhelming. Do you\ndislike stir-fry?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アイビー\nI don't have strong feelings about the menu.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nThen what does it mean when your face wears\nthis dubious look?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アイビー\nI am thinking.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アイビー\nYou have the ability to see the future.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アイビー\nYou never predict anything important, but your\npredictions are correct every single time.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nKind of you to notice!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アイビー\nIt was not a compliment. I don't understand\nhow you do it. I find it unsettling.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nI am unsettling? Why?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アイビー\nYou are an unknown quantity. I dislike\nunknown quantities.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nYou dislike me, Princess Ivy? We each have our\ntastes, I suppose, but...this makes me sad.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nWait! Even if you do not like me, I like you\nenough for both of us. So there is no problem!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アイビー\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アイビー\nHahaha!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アイビー\nYou are a strange one, Kagetsu.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nAh! There you are! There is your joy!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nTo bring such joy to your face is at least some\ncompensation for your dislike.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08アイビー\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06カゲツ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nAh! Princess Ivy! I was raised in Pale Sands.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アイビー\nOK... Why are you telling me this?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nYou said you dislike unknown quantities.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nSo, I am going to tell you everything about\nmyself. Then I will be known.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アイビー\nNot the worst idea, I'll grant you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nOnce you come to know me, we will no longer\nbe princess and retainer, but friend and friend!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nIt is worth trying, at least.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アイビー\nUh...haha...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nWhat else can I tell you? I have two siblings,\nbrother and sister. Both younger. Very cute.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nMy father has great swordsmanship. My mother\nhas strange powers, which perhaps came to me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nI care very much for my family, but I have also\nlong dreamed to see the world at large.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nThat is why I explained to them in writing my\ndecision to leave. And I am on this journey now.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アイビー\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nOh no! Have I done something wrong?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nHow foolish of me! I should not have presumed\nyou would wish to hear my entire life story.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nPlease forgive me, Princess Ivy. I should have\nnoticed sooner it was not what you wanted.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アイビー\nNo, that's not it. On the contrary, I am actually...\nrather pleased.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アイビー\nI had no idea that becoming friends with me\nwas so important to you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アイビー\nI'm flattered. Thank you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nAh, you are too kind!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アイビー\nI don't dislike you, Kagetsu.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アイビー\nI do dislike unknowns. They make me wary.\nBut that doesn't mean I dislike you as a person.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アイビー\nAnd after today, I think it's safe to say my\nimpression of you has improved.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nWonderful! So, we may become friends soon?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アイビー\nNot the worst idea.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08アイビー\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06カゲツ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nOur time has come, Princess Ivy! \x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nLet us draw anchor, hoist our mainsail, and set\nthis boat of friendship on its maiden voyage!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アイビー\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nHmm... It appears we are stuck in port.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nPerhaps I was mistaken, and it is not yet time.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アイビー\nThat's not it, Kagetsu.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nOh?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アイビー\nThe truth is...I don't have many friends.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アイビー\nWhen I was growing up, adults were always\nconniving and scheming.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アイビー\nI grew to learn that was how the world worked.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アイビー\nAs a result...it was quite a long time before I\nmet anyone I could trust enough to call a friend.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nAs crown princess, you must have been limited\nin your contacts.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nI imagine it was cold and harsh to be raised\nin this type of environment.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アイビー\nYes.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アイビー\nThat's why I found you so disconcerting at first.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アイビー\nWhen someone is friendly toward me right\naway, it's my instinct to be suspicious.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アイビー\nBut you've never tried to take advantage of me.\nYou don't seem to have any ulterior motives.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nHahaha! Of course not! I am much too simple\nfor schemes.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アイビー\nUntil recently, I couldn't have hoped to\nunderstand your...purity.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アイビー\nThat's why you felt like an unknown. You could\nnot be what you seemed, so...what were you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アイビー\nNow I've realized you're exactly as you appear.\nThat's your charm, in fact.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nOh! Such kind words.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アイビー\nSo, Kagetsu... That's why...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アイビー\nI would like us to be...friends.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nAre you certain? Wonderful, wonderful!\nYes, Princess Ivy! Of course!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nLet us be friends until time itself comes to\nits end!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アイビー\nHm-hm! Yes, let's.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
