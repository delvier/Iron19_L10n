MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08パンドロ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nSeadall, your movement is so...graceful.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nAs it should be. I am a professional dancer.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nYou know, watching you is giving me the urge\nto cut a rug myself.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nWhat do you say? Wanna dance together?\x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI've never danced like...that. The movements...\nthey don't match the rhythm. At all.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI understand why the others call it the Dance of\nDarkness. What a grotesque pantomime.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nReally? I had a great time.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nA great time? Is that enough for you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nUm... Define "enough."\x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nHmm. So that's how it goes, huh?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nYes, that's exactly how it goes. But don't worry,\nI'll teach you to dance correctly.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nAll right, if you insist! I doubt it'll take me too\nlong to pick it up.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08パンドロ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08セアダス\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nOne, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nTwo, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nUghhh!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nSeadall, you're counting wrong! It's messing\nup my flow!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nNo. You're not staying on the beat.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nI can't help it! I've been dancing to my own\nbeat for so long.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nHmm. We have to break your old habits and\nreally hammer home a solid foundation.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nYou're saying I can't dance the way I want?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI'm sorry, but no. It's for your own good.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nUrgh...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nLook, when I started, I couldn't dance a single\nstep. But my master worked with me, tirelessly.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nSometimes the training was so hard, I wanted to\nrun away. But now, I'm grateful for all of it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nAnd now I can teach you to dance, Pandreo,\njust like my master taught me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nI never asked you to do that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nBut...I thought you wanted to learn to dance?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nI wanted to have fun, and this? This is not fun.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nThanks for your tutelage or whatever. Brief as\nit was.\x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nPandreo.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nOh. Hey, Seadall. If you're trying to spring\nanother lesson on me, I'm not interested.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nAfter everything I taught you...your rhythm is\nstill just so awful.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nSo...what? Did you come here only to\ninsult me?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nNo, not at all. Honestly, I was just watching you\ndance...and I realized that I was wrong.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nHuh?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nEnjoying the dance─that's what's important.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI decided to teach you because I thought you\nwere having a hard time with it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nThat's how it looked, anyway. But just now,\nyou were dancing and loving it. I could see it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nI mean, yeah. I was having fun.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nThat's all that matters.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nIf my master heard me now, he'd be angry with\nme. But it's something I needed to learn.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nPandreo, I'm sorry I taught you not to\nenjoy dancing.\x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nReally?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nYeah. And I still want to. It's just that your\nlesson wasn't really my style.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nWhat do you say? Want to give it another try?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI'd be happy to.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nJust dance to the beat of your heart. You can't\ngo wrong if you do that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nThat's what I'm talking about! Come on, time to\nshimmy and shake in the name of fun! Ha!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nAnd then...how about another lesson? Nothing\ntoo tough. Just a quick, easy session.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
