MID_WU_C_1_IN_#001	Hehehe! You sleep so peacefully.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#001	Good morning, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#002	Need some more rest?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#003	Want me to fluff your pillow?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#001	I can scarcely believe...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#002	you slept this way for a thousand years. You\nlook so young and innocent.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#003	It makes me feel a certain sense of\nprotectiveness toward you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#001	Good morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#002	How are you today?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#003	Just let me know...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#004	if there's anything you need, all right?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#001	Goodness, what a view. Like something out of\na dream...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#001	Good morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#002	The scenery here is completely captivating.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#003	It's like you sleep inside a painting.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#001	I came here to wake you up, and I didn't even\nbring breakfast. How thoughtless of me!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#002	Maybe I have some snacks...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#003	Let's see... Hmm, I guess this folk food will have\nto do.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#001	Hey, Divine One! What would you say to an\ninteresting breakfast?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#002	We've got fried fish heads, offal, and...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#003	No? Are you sure?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#001	I get to wake the Divine Dragon!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#002	This is so exciting!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#001	Aw, you're up.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#002	I was excited to come in and wake you, but it\nwas all over so quickly...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#003	Slow down next time, OK?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#001	It's almost like the stories.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#002	A magical slumber...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#003	that can only be broken...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#004	by the right one stealing in, and...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#005	Well, me being the right one for that is a bit of\na stretch, I'm sure.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#001	Morning, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#002	Today promises to be another beautiful day.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#003	So get out there and make the most of it!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#001	I feel such solemnity approaching this place.\nThe Divine Dragon is a special figure...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#001	Oh, you heard all that?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#002	I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#003	If it helps, you wake up just like everyone else!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#001	I still feel bad about before.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#002	And since you didn't want that pickled fish\nI offered you...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#003	I decided to get you another special treat. I hope\nyou'll like this one.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#001	Good morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#002	I brought you some honey-glazed caterpillar!\nSweet, crunchy, and delicious!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#003	There's no need to panic, Divine One! It's\nperfectly safe! Go on, give it a try!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#001	Sorry I'm late! I got distracted shopping for\nthese snacks...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#001	Rousing aroma, isn't it?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#002	This charred meat is a rare delicacy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#003	No, I'm not going to tell you what it is! Haha,\ntry it first!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#001	Mmm, they smell amazing.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#002	I've been waiting ages to try charred snake.\nI never thought I'd get my hands on some.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#003	Maybe I'll sneak just one bite...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#004	No, I should wait for the Divine Dragon...\nOoo, I don't know if I can...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#001	Oh, uh, Divine One! Good morning!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#002	Excuse me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#003	Good morning, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#004	Eating? No, I wasn't eating anything.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#001	If your story became a fairy tale...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#002	it would start here in this room.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#001	The book that tells your story would have an\nillustration of you sleeping, I'm sure.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#002	And the one who came to wake you in\nthe morning...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#003	Well, it probably wouldn't be me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#001	Someday they'll tell stories about this war.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#002	When that day comes...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#003	you'll be a legend, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#004	That's a future I'm excited to look forward to.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#001	Good morning. I promise I haven't just been\nstaring at you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#002	I was thinking ahead to a future when everyone\nknows your story.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#003	Let's make it an amazing one, OK?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#001	Ready to turn the page on a new day in\nour story?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#001	Oh, you got up quickly!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#002	I'm glad to see you're as excited to start the\nday as I am.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#003	No need to rush, though. Why don't we stay in\nand chat a while first?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#001	Still peacefully asleep.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#002	If this were a fairy tale, I'd have to break a\nmagic spell to wake you up.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#003	Hehe, I guess it's good that it's not, since\nI wouldn't have the first idea where to start.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#004	But even if our lives aren't actually all\nthat storybook...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#005	I'm glad to live mine alongside you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#006	And just like in all the best stories, I think we'll\nlive happily ever after.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#001	Morning. Before we head out, why don't we\nspend some time together?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#002	We can forget all about this war business...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#003	and just relax and be happy for a while.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#001	Your sleeping face is as charming as ever.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#001	Has my coming here to wake you become\nan ordinary part of your life? Hehe!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#002	No matter how commonplace the days may be...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#003	for me, every moment I spend with you\nfeels extraordinary.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#001	When I became a knight...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#002	I didn't think my life could possibly get any\nmore exciting.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#003	But then our paths crossed, and I found myself\nwrapped up in this incredible story.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#004	A story that I'll now be a part of as it's passed\ndown to future generations.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#005	That's why I'm going to stay with you to the\nvery end of it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#006	So even after I pass on, you'll always be able to\nsee me in a storybook.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#001	Good morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#002	Let's keep scenes like this one out of the books.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#003	I want the quiet moments we share together...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#004	to stay purely between us.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
