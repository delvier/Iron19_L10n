MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08ヴェイル\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x12\x0Cセレスティア\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI brought you something to eat, Lady Veyle.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nAaah! Zephia...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nUmm...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nNo. It's Zelestia, isn't it? I'm sorry. Forget I\nsaid anything.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nAre you all right? You appear to be sweating.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	If you'll allow me, I can dab away the sweat\nfor you.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	Here, it won't take but a moment.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nAh, no! It's fine. I can do it myself.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nPlease, it's no bother at all. I want to take care\nof you.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	I could help with your hair! It's so pretty. I bet it\nwould look lovely done up.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	Oh, I know! I could braid it for you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nTh-thank you...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\n♪Hmm hm-hm─♪ Oh...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	Umm... How do you braid someone else's\nhair again?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nWhat?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nOh, I remember! If I were doing my own, I would\ncross one lock of hair over like so, and...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nOw, ow, ow! It hurts when you pull it that hard!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI'm sorry! Dear me, it's tangled now... Um, how\ndo I, uh...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nOh my... It's really tangled now. I'll fix it later.\nDon't worry about it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI'm truly sorry. I'll take my leave before I make\nthings any worse.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021	Aaah... I forgot to leave your meal.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nHeh...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#023	Zelestia's a bit overzealous, isn't she? It's...\nrather unexpected.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08ヴェイル\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x12\x0Cセレスティア\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nAre you tired, Lady Veyle? You don't look well.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nDo you think so? I feel fine.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nWere you injured in the battle earlier? Does\nanything hurt?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nI'm not injured. Look, fit as a fiddle. Although,\nmy nose is a little... Achoo!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nOh no, you must be chilly. We should warm you\nup before you catch a cold.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	Hmm...there's no blanket here. That's all right!\nI can just give you a hug!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nWhat?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nMage Dragons have a naturally high body\ntemperature. Don't worry, this is sure to help.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nI-I don't want... Stop it! That's enough...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	Don't come any closer!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nAh... I-I'm sorry.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nNo, I should be sorry. It was rude of me to be so\nforward, even if I just want to take care of you.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	You have my sincere apologies.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nIt's not that. It's just that you look so much like\nsomeone I used to know.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	I can explain a little more, if you have the time\nto listen.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nOf course.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nLong ago, I had a retainer. She was a Mage\nDragon, like you.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	She would treat me kindly and listen to me, the\nsame way you do.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	I thought maybe she and I could be friends.\nI really liked her.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	But then we were forced to fight on opposite\nsides, and that was the end of any friendship.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	I know you're not her. But you look so much\nalike that seeing you brings back memories.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI understand. Thank you for sharing something\nso personal with me.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024	I'll, um... I'll try not to be so forward in\nthe future.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025	When you're feeling up to it, could you tell me\nmore about this?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nYes. I'm sorry to be this way after you've been\nso kind to me, Zelestia.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#027	Thank you...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08ヴェイル\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x12\x0Cセレスティア\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nYour hair could use some attention, Lady Veyle.\nCome, let me fix it for you.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	Don't worry! I've been practicing!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nThen I'm all right with you doing it. Thank you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nOh, are you chilly? I'll go get a blanket before\nI attend to your hair.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nMage Dragons have a high body temperature,\nright? You could warm my hands in yours.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nOh, are you sure? I don't want you to\nbe frightened.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nYou're my friend. What's there to be afraid of?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	Tell me something... Why are you being so nice\nto me?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nWell, it's kind of a long story.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nI don't mind. This time it can be my turn\nto listen.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nIn my world, the Four Winds was started by a\nman named Mauvier.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nMauvier? So he was an admirable person in\nyour world too.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nVery much so. He was my hero and friend to\nthe last─someone I looked up to.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	I heard that he had a master, and that master's\nname was Lady Veyle.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nReally?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nYes, she had the same name as you.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	Mauvier had sworn to protect her no matter\nwhat. But it was an oath he was unable to keep.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	He said she died in a trifling battle. He always\nregretted the fact that he couldn't protect her.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	That's why I was so surprised to see you in this\nworld. To know that you're alive...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	If it was you he wanted to protect, then I will\ntake on that role as your protector now.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	That's why I wanted so badly to attend to you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nYou've been so nice, even though I've been so\ncold to you...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nNo. You've very kind. Even now, patiently\nlistening to my story like this.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	Mauvier always talked about how kind his\nLady Veyle was. Just like you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nI'm glad you told me that story.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026	It's miraculous that we met here. Though our\nworlds are different, we're connected somehow.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI believe so. There must be some power at work\nbringing us together like this.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nZelestia, the truth is, I do want to be friends\nwith you.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029	Could you maybe stay a little longer today?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI'd be delighted to. I'll stay by your side not just\na little longer, but for as long as you need me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
