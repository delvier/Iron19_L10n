MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nラファール\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThere you are, Rafal. I've been looking for you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nYou. What do you need?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nNothing. I just wanted to express my gratitude.\nI haven't had the chance to do it properly.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	So, thank you for coming to the Somniel.\nI'm grateful that you've joined us.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nI promised that we would meet again if my\nsister were to wake and forgive me.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	To go back on my word would be an insult to\nthat miraculous gift.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	Thus, I am here. The price for my allegiance has\nalready been paid. There is no need for thanks.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nEven so, your continued support means a lot\nto me. I can thank you for that, at least.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nYou are a strange one.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	It is absurd for you to trust me at all after what\nI have done. To be friendly is beyond the pale.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWhat if I just want you to be happy, after all\nwe've been through? Would that be so wrong?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	It's not like I could've let things end with you\nand Nel at odds. That would break my heart.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	Deep down, I know you're a good person.\nAnd I happen to like you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nYou...like me?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	Is that truly what people say?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWhy not? What's wrong with it?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nEnough! Do you have no duties of your own to\nattend to? Leave me be!\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHey, wait a second!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nラファール\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nGreat weather we're having today, wouldn't\nyou say, Rafal? Perfect for a long walk.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nYou. Did you retain nothing of what I said?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	Did I not tell you to leave me be?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI remember, but I have so much I want to talk\nto you about that I couldn't possibly stay away.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nYou could at least sound less pleased with\nyourself about it. The tone is not endearing.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	Very well then, out with it. What is it you\nwished to discuss?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI was going to ask you about all your likes and\ndislikes, but if I have to pick just one topic...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	I'd like to know how you spent your time while\nyou were waiting for Nel to wake up.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nThere is little to know. I waited. Alone.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	If you insist on details... I held her hand, and I\nprayed continually that she would wake.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	I prayed for another opportunity to be a brother\nto her. A proper one this time.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	I wanted the chance to make her happy. And\nabove all, I wanted her to know my true name.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI see...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nBeyond that, my thoughts were simple. If she\ndoes not wake today, then perhaps tomorrow.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	Before I knew it, a thousand years had passed.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nMy mother's experience must have been similar.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nThe time was nothing to me. The days prior to\nher awakening were an insignificant blur.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	But I will never forget the smile she gave me on\nthe day she finally woke.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	At any rate, that is all there is to tell. She woke,\nwe came here, and you know the rest.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou say that like waiting a thousand years was\ntrivial. It wasn't. Not just anyone could do that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nYour praise is uncalled for. My motivations\nwere entirely selfish, I assure you.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	All the same, I do not think I would have done it\nif not for what you said before we parted ways.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023	In that regard, you are as responsible for Nel's\nreturn as I am. And you have my thanks.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHaha, you sounded a bit like Nel just then.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025	You might say the resemblance between you\nis almost familial at this point.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nAfter all that, you mock me?! This conversation\nwas a mistake.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nNo, Rafal. I didn't mean─\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#028	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nEnough of this prattle! Goodbye!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nラファール\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nYou. Take these.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHuh? What's this? A bundle of... Oh, there are\nsweets inside!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nThe kitchen staff held me hostage until I made\nthese confections. I did what had to be done.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou made these from scratch? For me? They\nlook wonderful, Rafal! Thank you so much!\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	Do you mind if I have some now?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nDo as you like, though there is something you\nshould know.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	The treats come in two varieties. One is quite\nordinary, while the other is a...special flavor.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'll admit I'm curious, but I think I'll save the\nspecial kind for last. Let's try a regular one.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	*cough* Sweet! Too sweet! Ugh, it burns!\nIs it supposed to burn?!\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	You call that ordinary flavor?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nHahaha! This whole endeavor was worth it for\nthe look on your face alone.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	I should have clarified─I meant ordinary for me.\nAny less sweet than that and I taste nothing.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI shudder to think what your idea of a special\nflavor is. I don't know if I have it in me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nIf the fear is too much to bear, you can simply\ngive them away. Or discard them altogether.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou know better than to suggest that. OK,\nyou've convinced me. Here goes nothing!\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	Oh. Oh wow. This one's amazing. It's all my\nfavorite flavors combined in perfect balance...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nWith your sensitive palate in mind, I used an\nexceptionally small amount of each flavoring.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nSo that's what you meant by special.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nI would encourage you to savor these treats,\nbecause they are the last I will ever produce.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	Not that I regret the effort spent. As folk here\nsay, actions are stronger gratitude than words.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIt's been an incredible experience. Thank you.\nI can tell you put your heart into making them.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	There's just one problem, Rafal.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nWhat is that?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHow am I supposed to find room in my stomach\nfor dinner?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nHm-hm! Walk it off, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nラファール\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThanks for giving me a hand with the supplies.\nI couldn't have done all that without you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nI had some spare time. Think nothing of it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIt wasn't nothing, though. You did almost all the\nheavy lifting.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004	I should make it up to you. Oh, I know─how\nabout I brew you a nice cup of tea later?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nYour gentle demeanor perplexes me. How can\nyou be so caring in the middle of a bitter war?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006	I was shocked to learn that you are a Fell\nDragon in this world.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007	If you had been born one of my siblings, your\ndisposition would have led you to a quick death.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHm-hm! Tell me how you really feel.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nThese are not my feelings. These are facts.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010	You are helpful to a fault, heedless of your own\nburdens, and recklessly curious. In short, a fool.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou seem to kind of enjoy spending your time\naround fools lately.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012	You journeyed from another world to risk your\nlife for a fool─who's very grateful, incidentally.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nSay what you like.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI will, because even if you'd never admit it,\nI know that you listen and you care.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015	I see that clearly now.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nHeh...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nBut you said actions express gratitude better\nthan words, Rafal, and you were right.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018	I've been thinking about it for a while now,\nand I've decided I want you to have this.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nIs that what I think it is?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIt's the Pact Ring─a symbol of a deep and\nspecial bond. A partnership.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nI may possess superficial charm, but giving this\nto me would be foolish even by your standard.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022	Moreover, it would be wrong. I have done\nnothing to earn such an honor.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023	Any partner of yours should be more...pure.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'm a Fell Dragon just like you, remember?\nYou said so yourself.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025	I fought on Sombron's side once too. I'm every\nbit as "impure" as you are.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nEven so...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou're the one I want to give this to, Rafal.\nYou and nobody else.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#028	You're already an indispensable part of my life.\nI'm only asking you to continue to be that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#029	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\n...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#030	When you put it that way, it seems I have little\nchoice. Who else will keep an eye on you?\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#031	Very well, you have my word. I will remain by\nyour side, fighting for your cause, until the end.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#032	Even if the rest of the world should turn against\nyou, I will be here. I swear it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#033	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThank you. That means a great deal to me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#034	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nI will only say this once, so mark me well.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#035	You said that you wanted me to be happy.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#036	When I first came here, I was content merely to\nembark upon a new life as a new person.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#037	But the more time I spend with you, the more I...\nmiss you when you are absent.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#038	So, in return for my oath, I would like you to\nswear something to me, \x0E\x06\x03\x00.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#039	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nSwear that you will never leave my side─that\nwe will explore what the future holds together.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
