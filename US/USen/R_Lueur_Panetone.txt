MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08パネトネ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nHYAAA!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThat was incredible!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nYes. Learn to strike with that much force and\nyou are sure to trounce all comers.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nIn truth, I was rather surprised when you asked\nme for lessons in brawling.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nI take it you wish to give someone a forceful\ntalking-to. A debtor, perhaps?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWhat? No, nothing like that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI figure that I could lose my weapon when I'm\nin battle or get ambushed when I'm not.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nJust in case, it's best I learn how to hold my\nown in physical combat.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nI see. That is quite shrewd, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nVery well. I shall instruct you in the ancient art\nof the fisticuffs.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nHow to hone an indomitable spirit. How to\nrepel foes with a mere scowl.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nThere is much I can teach you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI see. Well, I'm ready to learn!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nGood. I will make you into the most fearsome of\nscrappers. Let us begin!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08パネトネ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nIn a brawl, the most crucial blow is the first.\nVictory oft rests on attacking before your foe.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nThus, you must be agile─agile enough to strike\nwith a raptor's swiftness!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nBe agile. Got it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nThat way, even if your enemies do attack first,\nyou will be able to evade their fists.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nMakes sense...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nIs something the matter, Divine One?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'm just surprised that a noblewoman like you\nknows so much about brawling.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nI suppose there is no need to obscure the truth.\nThe woman standing before you is not a noble.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nWhy, in time past, she was quite wild indeed.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nReally?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nYes. My parents were awful─gallivanting about\nwith nary a thought for their children.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nSo I fled. Before the princess appointed me,\nI lived a roaming, solitary life.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nIt was then that I learned how to fistfight.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'm sorry you had to endure all of that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nSorry? If not for running away from that\nwretched home, I would hardly be who I am.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI see. Well... Would you like to tell me more\nabout your past?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI think it might help me to hear about your life\nbefore you met Princess Timerra.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nWhy, of course.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nIf my stories of woe can help you, I would be\nall too happy to share them.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08パネトネ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nAw, damn. I guess it won't be so easy to find\nthem after all.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nPanette? You're up late.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nAh! Good evening, Divine One!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWhat's that letter you're reading?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nI employed a Solmic investigator to find my\nparents. This is her report.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nAlas, it seems the search has come up empty.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHuh. I thought you said your parents were\nhorrible people.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nYes, well... Our conversation made me realize\nI have some feelings in need of resolution.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nI thought perhaps now, with the benefits of\ntime, I could speak to them with a cooler head.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nThus my desire to track them down...assuming\nthey are still alive, of course.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'm impressed. It's brave of you to try facing\nthem after all these years.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nPanette, how about I help find your parents?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nNo, no... I would not dream of such\nan imposition!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIt's the least I can do to repay you for\nyour training.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nBesides, we've seen our share of dangerous\nbattles together.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou, me, the others─we have a connection.\nWe help each other. Let me help you, please.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nVery well, then. I will gratefully accept your aid.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nTruth be told, even if we do not find my\nparents, I have already found my family.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nWhat more do I truly need?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08パネトネ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nNo word on your missing parents today, I take\nit? Don't lose hope yet. We'll keep looking.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nDivine One... I have come to the conclusion that\nit is time to abandon the search for my parents.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nBut...why?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nIt is regrettable, but we have searched high\nand low. There is nothing more to be done.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nThat said, I thank you, sincerely. You have been\na steadfast companion throughout.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nSearching for my parents with you has been...\nenjoyable. I hope we can continue on together.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIf that's what you want, Panette, then yes,\nI would like to continue on with you. Always.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nI─ I don't understand...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI told you before we had a connection, but it's\nmore than that. I mean, I want us to be more.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nPlease, take this.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nThat's...the Pact Ring.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou're supposed to give it to someone you\ncare for deeply. For me, that's you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nDivine One...I─ I cannot.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nMy parents were once wildly happy with one\nanother. But in time, their relationship soured.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nPeople's feelings change. I cannot bear the\nthought of that happening to us.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThat was your past, Panette. You have a whole\nfuture ahead of you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nEveryone has their ups and downs. You and\nI too─good times and otherwise.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nBut you have the agility of a raptor, and now\nso do I. We can evade anything together.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nHaha! Over and over again, you astonish me,\nDivine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nI see I've impressed upon you the importance of\nagility. But what of the rest of the brawler's art?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nNothing to do with us. So, what do you think?\nWill you accept this ring?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nYes. I will, gladly.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nStay with me, from now until\nforever, \x0E\x06\x03\x00.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOf course. I am your partner and you are mine.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nI like the sound of that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nI can think of no one I'd rather fight beside.\nYou are the one I truly adore.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
