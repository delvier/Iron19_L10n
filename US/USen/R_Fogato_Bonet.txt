MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nフォガート\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0A\x04ボネ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nMm, yes! This grilled fish is divine. Mm! It has\nsuch a supple mouthfeel.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nI added a pinch of salt to suck out the moisture.\nThat makes the fish nice and tender.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nMight be your finest work yet, Bunet, and that's\nsaying something.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nWell, after all, I'm not just your retainer but also\nyour personal chef.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nIt is my duty to know what you like and prepare\nyour meals accordingly.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nI know! I'm a lucky man.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nBut you forgot one thing.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nWhat?! Does it need more lemon? Is the\npresentation not to your liking?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nOh, not the dish─the titles. Retainer, personal\nchef. You left one out.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nBest friend.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nAh. Right you are, Fogado.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nWe have a long history─sharing meals together\nin my parents' bistro almost every day.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nMore than the meals, it was the hours we spent\ntalking─well after patrons left─that I cherished.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nYes. I'll always remember those days. Unlike\nsomebody, who forgot we were even friends...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nI didn't forget. For friends and flavors alike,\nmy memory is long and exacting.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nIt's just that now I see you as more of a savior\nthan a friend.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nPsh, a savior? Me? How come?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nHeh... You don't understand. Of course.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nNever mind that. Just finish your meal before it\ngets cold. Dessert will be ready shortly.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nDessert? Oh, baby!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nThis is the best food in the world, bar none.\nI'll have a clean plate in no time.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nThe best food in the world... Heh...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nフォガート\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0A\x04ボネ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nMm, delicious! Yet another culinary\ntriumph, Bunet.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nI could tell you were enjoying it because of that\nscrumptious smile on your face.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nOh, before I forget. We need to circle back and\ntalk about what you said the other day.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nWhat do you mean?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nYou know, the "savior" thing. I've been racking\nmy brain, but I can't figure out what you meant.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nOh. That.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nI entered that contest to become the royal\ncourt's chef, and...I lost.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nIt was the greatest shame of my life.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nYet you found it in your heart to overlook my\nfailure and hire me as your personal chef.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nI could never pay you back for that kindness.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nAh, I see. But, Bunet, I didn't really care about\nthe contest itself.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nI was just glad that you entered because it\nbrought you back into my life.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nWhat? Was that your plan all along?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nOf course. It had been years since the last time\nwe talked at your parents' bistro.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nThat's true... What a bitter separation that was.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nBut perhaps we should put this conversation on\nthe backburner. Your main course is ready.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nYou wouldn't want a sour memory to detract\nfrom the delightful flavor.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nYou make a good point.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nWhoa! What a stunning dish! Your food really is\nthe best in the world.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nフォガート\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0A\x04ボネ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nMm! Well, that's dessert done with. What a\nsatisfying meal.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nYour delectable praise is a boon to my soul.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nDid I detect a note of bitterness? Setting the\nstage for a hard conversation, I bet.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nIndeed. Something you said has been eating at\nmy mind. You...searched for me?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nYeah. When I heard about the bandit raid on\nyour town, I was devastated.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nThere was basically nothing left. Your parents'\ncozy bistro...a pile of ashes.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nThat image is burned in my memory.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nI felt so helpless. I had come as fast as I could,\nbut...it was too late.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nYou'd fled along with everyone else. I had no\nidea where you might have gone.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nI'm sorry... It all happened so suddenly, I didn't\nhave a chance to tell you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nIt wasn't your fault. At any rate...after you left,\nI never stopped looking for you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nI missed your delicious cooking, but more\nthan that, I missed our conversations.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nI missed them too.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nAnd then when I heard about the cooking\ntournament, I knew you'd enter.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nThere was no way you'd miss a chance to show\noff to the whole queendom.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nIf you think about it, your culinary skills are the\nreason we were reunited.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nI did lose the contest, however.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nHeh heh─this again! Bunet, it's not a big deal.\nYou were out of practice.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nIf there was another contest today, you'd win\nhands down.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nOh, Fogado... Thank you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nI'm grateful you kept looking for me. That is\nwhy we can enjoy delicious moments like this.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nYou truly are my savior.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\n"Savior" still feels a little...strong, but, eh,\nI'll take it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nAnd just so you know...I'm never letting you\nleave me like that again.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nThe feeling is entirely mutual.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nI am your personal chef and retainer.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nMost importantly, I am your best friend. And as\nsuch, I swear to be true.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nフォガート\nI'm glad. Nothing is sweeter than your\nfriendship, Bunet.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
