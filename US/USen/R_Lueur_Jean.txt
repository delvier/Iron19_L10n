MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nThis one acts as a painkiller, and this one is\nuseful in several ointments.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nIt used to grow all over my home island, but it's\ngotten harder to find lately.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nSo I'm picking some here to send back to\nmy father.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nFor the clinic on your island, right?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThis is a lot for one person to harvest alone.\nLet me help you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nNo, no, no, that's OK! You must have a lot of\nother important things to do, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nNot so many that I can't lend a hand here.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nBesides, with the war and your studies, I bet\nyou're so busy, you barely have time to sleep.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nHm-hm, I should've known the Divine One\nwould see right through me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThat's right. Nothing gets by me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nIf you really wouldn't mind, then yes, it would\nbe a big help. Thank you!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ジャン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nPicking herbs again today, I see.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nThis one really makes a difference in treating\nall kinds of illnesses and injuries back home.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nI used to go out all the time with my father\nto harvest these.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI didn't get to talk much with your father on\nthe island. What's he like?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nWhenever I succeed, in studies or in helping out,\nhe praises me like a well-behaved puppy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nBut when I mess up, he gets very upset, like\nhe's scolding a misbehaving puppy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nSo you're a puppy either way, huh?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nHaha, now that you mention it...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nHe was the kind of dad where some days we\ngot along, and some days I hated him.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nBut in his absence, I appreciate him more.\nSame with my mother.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nI didn't realize it when I saw them every day,\nbut I have a lot of respect for my parents.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nI think the only reason I work so hard now is\nbecause of the way they raised me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nJean...that's so beautiful...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nHuh?! Are you crying?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThat story about your family was just...\nvery touching.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nThank you, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nHere, take this poultice. It's good for swelling\naround the eyes.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHaha, thanks, Jean. I needed that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ジャン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI have something for you, Jean.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nMedicinal herbs? Oh! This is quite a lot.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI found a place full of them in the forest, so I\npicked as many as I could.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nWow...thank you so much. This is going to make\na big difference back home.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWhat you said about your parents really struck\nme. I want to help your family as much as I can.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nThanks, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nHey, what happened to your arm? It's all\nscratched up.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOh, right after I found the patch of herbs,\nI slipped and tumbled down a hill.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nOh no! Here, sit down, and I'll treat it right now.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIt doesn't really bother me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nPlease, Divine One. I'd hate for your wounds to\nstay open and get infected.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nAll right. Go ahead, then.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nLet's see here...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nYou know, Divine One, I think it was good that\nI left the island to travel with you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYeah?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nYou're a very generous person, but you don't\nknow how to be generous to yourself.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nAs long as I'm around, no matter how little care\nyou have for your well-being, you'll be fine.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nI want to pay you back a hundred times over\nfor all the kindness you've shown me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWow.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nThere. All treated. It should heal quickly now.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThanks! And I'm glad to have you along too.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ジャン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWe pulled up a pretty big haul today.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nMostly thanks to you. You're not tired from\nworking so hard?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHaving you along made it fun. I feel like I could\nkeep going for hours.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nUh-oh. Looks like you're hurt again.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHuh? Oh, no. That's from the last battle.\nI stepped in to protect an ally.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI had it healed right afterward, but I guess it still\nleft a mark.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nYou should try this. It's an ointment I made\nfrom the herbs we picked last time.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nIf you smear it on, it should keep the redness\ndown. You'll have to wait a bit for it to dry.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThank you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nIf you're ever hurt...or even just in trouble,\nI hope you know you can count on me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nI want you to be able to count on me the way\nso many others are counting on you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nBut, Jean, don't you know?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI already do.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nYou─ You do?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOf everyone in the army, you're somebody\nI know I can always rely on.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIn fact, I've been thinking you deserve to have\nthis Pact Ring I've been carrying.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nI don't know... Something that precious should\ngo to someone worthier.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI can't think of anyone worthier than you.\nYou've always been there for me, after all.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nWell... I guess that makes sense.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nThank you. From now on, you can consider\nme your personal physician!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI wouldn't have it any other way.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nBut if that's how it's going to be, I've got a lot\nof reading and practice to get to.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nThe Divine One's personal physician had better\nnot make any mistakes!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nTake your time. Once this war is over, I should\nhave a lot fewer injuries to patch up.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nTrue. Um, \x0E\x06\x03\x00...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nThanks for believing in me. I'll work hard to\nbecome a doctor worthy of treating you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
