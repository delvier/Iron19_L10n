MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ラピス\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOh, Lapis! I wanted to thank you for all of your\nsupport in our recent battles.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nOh, I didn't really do much out there.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nI was just following your lead. You don't have\nto thank me for that, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nThere were lots of other, more skilled warriors\nin those battles. You should thank them instead.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nLapis, please. You're strong and you think fast.\nYou should have confidence in your abilities.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nConfidence? I don't know about that...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nI'm thrilled to be a retainer, but everyone else\nis much more qualified. I'm not even a noble.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nI wouldn't want to sound arrogant when I rank\nso far beneath everyone else.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWow. You're pretty hard on yourself, huh?\nI guess that can be a good motivator...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nBut you shouldn't compare yourself to others\nlike that. Everyone has different skills.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nBe a little more kind to yourself, OK? Like I said,\nyou've earned a bit of confidence.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nBut... Well, Divine One, I... I'm not sure what to\nsay to all of that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nI'm not used to being complimented like this.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nI should go. Please excuse me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x04\x03\x04
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nLapis sounds so sure that she doesn't really\nbelong here.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThere has to be some way to help her work\npast that mindset.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ラピス\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nHuh?! You're serious? You really want to train\nwith me today, Divine One?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYes! I thought it would be nice to work together\nevery once in a while.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nThat's so exciting! Thank you for carving out\nthe time.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nSo, what am I in for, Lapis? What's your usual\ntraining regimen?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nI start with some drills using different weapons,\ntry a few practice swings...then do heavy lifting.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nI strap a weighted pack to my back and go for\na long run. Sometimes I climb a mountain.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThat...seems like it would build up an incredible\namount of endurance.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nOh, if you're going to train with me, you'll need\na pack too. I'll make you one real quick!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou're going to make a weighted pack?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nSure! It's not too hard. I had to make most\nthings by hand back in the countryside.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nCountryside?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nAh!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nAhh! I...I meant, "can't decide!" I can't decide,\nuh, whether to make you a pack or not!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOh. Well, I'd love it if you did. I think it's really\namazing you can make those kinds of things.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nOoh, please don't tease me like that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'm not teasing. Your crafting skills could be\nvery useful on the battlefield.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWould you be willing to teach me how to make\na few things? I'd like to learn.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nIt feels...strange to be complimented for such\na modest skill.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nBut yes, I can show you how to make a pack\nright now. Watch closely!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nAll right.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWhoa! Your hands move so fast! Can we, uh,\ngo back a few steps?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ラピス\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nHello, Divine One. I have something for you!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nAre these crafting tools?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nYep! You said you wanted to learn crafting, and\nyou can't practice without a set of your own.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThank you for these.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nI should be thanking you, really.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nI've been down on myself for a long time.\nYou helped me shake some of that off.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nYour kind words about my crafting skills made\nme feel more confident in myself.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nGood! You really are amazing, Lapis.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI watched you make that weighted pack like it\nwas nothing. I still have a lot to learn from you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nOK! I could show you how to make a rake.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nA rake? What would we use that for?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nHarvesting taters.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nTaters.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nYeah! I can make a rake that works on all kinds.\nPotatoes, sweet potatoes, Brodian yams...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nBrodian yams?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nWell, Brodia is in the name, but they can grow\neverywhere. I even found a few near here!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nThey're so sweet when you boil them... Ugh,\nnow I want some. Let's get started on that rake!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nAmazing. Like I said, I still have a lot to learn\nfrom you, Lapis.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ラピス\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHello, Lapis. Do you have a moment?\x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_RELIANCE_S_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nWow. What is this? The metalwork is beautiful.\nIt looks all fancy and expensive... Ah! Wait!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nIs... Is this the Pact Ring?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIt is. Look at the back side.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nWhy is my name engraved here?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI carved it there using the crafting tools you\ngave me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nWhat? You did this to the ring yourself? Using\nthe tools I made for you?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nAhh, an engraving like this can't be removed!\nWhy did you do this?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI have no intention of undoing it. I carved your\nname into it because I want you to have it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWhat do you say, Lapis? Will you wear the\nPact Ring?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nYou know, there was a time when a situation\nlike this would've had me fleeing in shame...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nBut...I care about you, Divine One. And it\ndoesn't matter what anyone else thinks.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nDoes that mean...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nOf course. I will accept this ring.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nYou took such care in carving my name into it...\nHow could I possibly say no after that?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThank you, Lapis. I'm so glad.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nUm... I actually have something important to tell\nyou, Divine One. You see, I...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou're from a village of yam farmers, right?\nWay out in the Brodian countryside?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nHuh? How did you know that?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI read up on Brodian yams. It's just a nickname.\nThe only people who call them that are...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nYam farmers. Ugh. My secret is out...but I think\nI'm glad. That's a big part of who I am.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIndeed. And I'm giving you the Pact Ring\nbecause of who you are, Lapis.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nThank you, Divine Dragon \x0E\x06\x03\x00...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ラピス\nYou'll be safe with me. It turns out we're both\npretty crafty...so let's carve out a better world!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
