MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0A\x04ボネ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ジャン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nWow, that's pretty swollen. This is definitely\nsome sort of insect sting.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nWell, I tend plants on the side. Probably got\nstung while I was in the garden.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nI can give you some herbs to reduce the\nswelling. Take care not to touch the wound.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nI'm sure there's no need for that. Save your\nherbs for someone who could really use them.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nIt doesn't work like that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nWe don't know what kind of insect stung you.\nIf you leave it untreated, it might get serious.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nI see... Forgive me. I suppose you would be\nmore knowledgeable about such things.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nIt's all right. Now you know. Just let me apply\nthe dressing like so, and...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nAll done. Nothing to worry about now. Just\nleave it be, even if it starts to itch.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nUnderstood. I'll try not to touch it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nPlease, take this. A small token of thanks.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nWow... What's this pretty flower?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nSome chamomile from my garden. It has a nice,\nsoothing aroma, don't you think?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nThank you. I appreciate it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nYou ought to come visit my garden sometime.\nI think you'd like it there.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0A\x04ボネ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ジャン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nHow's that insect sting healing, Bunet?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nThe swelling has stopped. All thanks to those\nherbs of yours, no doubt.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nSomehow, I resisted the urge to taste them.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nHahaha, a good patient is patient.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nEverything looks fine where you were stung.\nThat's a relief.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nThank you, Jean.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nOh, this reminds me. I wanted to ask you\nabout something.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nWhat's that?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nRemember the chamomile you gave me?\nI looked into it, and it has medicinal uses.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nIt's a painkiller and can sometimes reduce\ninflammation. Do you maybe have more?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nInteresting.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nWell, there's not much of it, but what I do have,\nI will gladly give you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nThank you. Even a little will help.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nIt makes me happy to know that my little\nflowers will help people feel better.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nThough, I must say...I'll be sorry to see them\nleave home after all my careful tending.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nDon't worry, Bunet. I won't let a single flower\ngo to waste.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0A\x04ボネ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ジャン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nYou did me a big favor the other day.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nI put that flower you gave me to good use, and\nit helped in treating a lot of our people.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nGood. I'm sure those little blooms of mine were\nhappy to help.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nHere. This is something in return.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nHm... Flower seeds.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nYou seemed to care a lot about the flower you\ngave me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nSo I thought it must have made you sad to see\nthe space where it used to grow.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nThis probably isn't much of a replacement,\nbut...it's something to fill the space.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nHow thoughtful. I will make sure to give these\nseeds a loving, supportive home.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nIt's the least I can do for the help you gave me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nWell, I think that's all, so...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nJean, wait.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nYes?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nAre there any other flowers with medicinal uses\nthat I could grow for you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nSometimes I'm sad to see my beautiful flowers\nbeing plucked, but not when they help people.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nI want to contribute however I can.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nThat's really nice of you, Bunet. It means a lot\nthat you're willing to pitch in.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nI'm going to do my part, too, of course. I won't\nleave it all to you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nWonderful. I'm sure my flowers will appreciate\nhaving another caretaker around.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nHaha, probably so! Keep up the good work, and\ntry not to get stung again.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04ボネ\nNo need to tell me twice. I could hardly sleep\nwith those tantalizing herbs on me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
