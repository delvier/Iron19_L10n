MID_WU_C_1_IN_#001	I never thought the day would come that I'd be\nallowed to approach the altar.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#001	Divine One, good morning!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#002	If you don't mind...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#003	I'd like to offer up a prayer.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#001	So, I'm...supposed to wake the Divine Dragon?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#002	A frightening thought...but...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#003	I mustn't let the Divine Dragon oversleep.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#004	Steel yourself, Pandreo... Ahem! Divine One!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#001	Ah, I see you are awake!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#002	What a divine sight...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#003	As a cleric, I have no choice but to pray.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#001	I have purified my mind and body. Only now\nmay I enter such a holy place...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#001	Oh no.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#002	My purification rituals failed.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#003	Forgive me, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#004	This befouled follower never meant to offend\nyour senses.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#001	What a beautiful altar.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#002	Ooo, I could throw an epic party here.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#003	No!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#004	I mustn't think such wicked thoughts or the\nDivine Dragon will sense them.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#001	Gah!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#002	D-Divine One!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#003	I only meant to say a prayer.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#004	Pandreo, you party-loving fool!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#001	Divine One! AROOO!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#001	Ugh.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#002	That was weird, huh?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#003	It's just...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#004	sometimes this place makes me nervous.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#005	I'm sorry if I was rude.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#001	Woo!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#002	No more snoozing for you!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#003	I'm usually nervous here. But not today!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#004	Nope. Still nervous. And now, disrespectful too.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#001	Aaaah!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#002	I'm sorry, Divine One!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#003	Please forgive my forced enthusiasm!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#004	You don't...have a confession booth in here,\ndo you?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#001	"When the dragon child rises from their slumber\non the dais, saved the world will be." Hm.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#001	Sorry.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#002	I was thinking about that prophecy...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#003	and decided to come here.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#004	I want you to know...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#005	it saved me. It really did.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#001	I never believed that prophecy would\ncome true like...this.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#002	When the priest talked about the\n"dragon child"...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#003	I always pictured, you know, a small child.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#004	But the prophecy actually turned out...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#001	Oh! You heard all that?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#002	What was I about to say?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#003	Well, I was going to say, the prophecy turned\nout better than I imagined.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#004	I don't mean any disrespect. It's just nice we\nget to be friends.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#001	Divine One, please permit me to break\nthis silence for a moment...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#001	Oh, sorry.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#002	I just felt the need to pray after battle.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#003	You don't mind?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#004	Thank you for understanding.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#005	Your kindness never ceases to amaze me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#001	It's so quiet here, as if all that fighting\nnever happened.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#002	Perhaps my prayers can reach the sky\nfrom here...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#003	can reach those who have gone on to\nbecome stars.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#004	We pray, please grant peace to all those\nlost souls.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#001	I'm sorry for waking you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#002	It's just that after a battle... After I've stained\nthese hands of mine...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#003	prayer brings me comfort...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#004	even if it doesn't bring me forgiveness.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#001	Divine One! AR-AROOO!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#001	Good morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#002	Uh, so, at that party the other day...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#003	you heard everyone howling.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#004	Sometimes we just can't help it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#005	I...hope that's OK.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#001	Hmm...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#002	I'm so happy to be here, I want to howl.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#003	And the Divine Dragon seems to like it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#004	But it's so crass and unbecoming.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#001	Ah, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#002	Thank you for attending the party the\nother day.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#003	Thanks to you it was a total success and...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#004	Huh? What's that look for?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#005	OK. Fine. But only because you asked for it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#006	AROOO!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#001	Divine One, it's time to get up.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#002	A clear, beautiful day awaits.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#001	Good morning, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#002	What do you mean I'm being too formal\nwith you? We'll see about that...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#003	Good morning, to you whom I very much adore.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#004	I hope that will suffice, my dear Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#001	It still feels like a dream, you know?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#002	You, the Divine Dragon, gave me─ME─the\nPact Ring.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#003	Every time I look at it, I get so happy I think\nI might start crying.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#004	Oh, I know I'll become a star in the heavens\nlong before you do.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#005	But you and I, we have a bond.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#006	And I know my hand will hold your\nhand forever.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#001	Morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#002	Come, it's time for battle.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#003	No matter how many lives I have to take...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#004	I'll gladly face the judgment that awaits...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#005	if it means protecting you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#001	AROOO!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#002	Ugh. It's still awkward around the\nDivine Dragon.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#001	I'm sorry.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#002	I just lose my cool whenever I'm here.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#003	I can't help it. I have some very, very\nstrong feelings.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#004	I hope you can forgive me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#001	I mean...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#002	my own deity gave me the Pact Ring.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#003	I can't just, you know...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#004	be casual about it all of a sudden.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#005	It's probably going to take some time to get\nused to. Like, maybe a lot of time.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#006	But I don't mind.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#007	I like that awkward squeeze I feel in my heart\nevery time I think about you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#001	Good morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#002	You heard all that?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#003	Hm, that's embarrassing.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#004	But when it comes to my feelings...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#005	I don't want to hide them anymore.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
