MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06クロエ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nHehehe, you're so adorable when you sleep,\nDivine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHuh?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nOh, good morning. Did I wake you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWere you watching me sleep? Again?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nYes. Sorry about that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou should just leave me be if I nod off while\nI'm sitting outside.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIt's unnerving to wake up on your own and find\nsomeone staring at you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nOh, I never mean to do that, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nBut you slept for a thousand years, just like\na character from a fairy tale.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nYour sleeping form is so heavenly that I can't\nhelp staring at it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI get that. But I still must have been a ridiculous\nsight, sleeping here of all places.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nOh, no! Not at all.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nBut I have a compromise in mind. Hear me out.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nIf I'm always there when you wake up, maybe\nyou'll get used to it and it won't be so startling.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nAll we'd have to do is set up an extra bed for\nme in your chamber.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nNope! Not doing that!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nOh dear. Shot down...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06クロエ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nYou slept for a thousand years.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nAnd when you woke, you were thrust into battle\nagainst the forces of evil.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nYou're the absolute picture of a fairy-tale hero!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nUh...am I?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nOh yes. One doesn't meet people as\nextraordinary as you every day.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nYours is not the average person's life. You are\nfated for exhilaration and excitement!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nOh, how I wish it were mine...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI don't know...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nWhat? Why not?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThere are many burdens I must bear, and while\nI don't regret this life...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou're absolutely right that my days will never\nbe considered average.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nSometimes, average seems like it might not\nbe so bad.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nOh. I'm really sorry about that. I was just so\nswept up in my own desire for a fairy-tale life...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nI didn't stop to consider how someone already\nliving one might feel.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou don't have to apologize, Chloé. I know you\ndidn't mean anything by it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nI still feel a little guilty, though.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nOh, I know! I'll bring you a special, delicious\ntreat as an apology.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nThere's this rare, pickled, deep-sea fish I've\nbeen into. It's sour enough to knock you flat!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nI'll go fetch some right now. You're gonna\nlove it!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nNo need! Really! I'm getting queasy enough\njust picturing it!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06クロエ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou know, I've noticed how often you bring up\nyour wish to live a fairy-tale life...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nUh-huh. I've wanted that for myself ever since\nI was a child.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nI was born into a noble family. Everything in my\nlife was planned out for me by my parents.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nMy role as a noble daughter was to get married\nand then devote myself to my partner's family.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nThey wouldn't even let me eat the street food\nI love so much.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nIt wasn't ordinary for a noble girl. I hated every\npart of that life.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI had no idea.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nThe life I wanted for myself was free, thrilling,\nand very out of the ordinary.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI didn't mean to stir up so many painful\nmemories, Chloé.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nOh, it's OK. They're just memories. And my\ndream came true when I got to be a knight.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nMeeting Princess Céline─and you─let me live\nthe kind of life I always fantasized about.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nIsn't fighting alongside the Divine Dragon and\nthe royal family better than any fairy tale?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWhen you put it like that, you might be right.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nI wonder if they'll tell stories about this\nwar someday.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIt's certainly possible. And when they do...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI wouldn't be surprised if you ended up as a\nmajor character in them.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nWhat?! I...never thought about that. But it's a\nnice idea!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nI must become the kind of virtuous knight little\nkids aspire to be when they hear the story.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou're already well on your way there, Chloé.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nHaha, thanks, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06クロエ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI think you've been rubbing off on me, Chloé.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nI have? How?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nJust like you wish for a fairy-tale life, I've been\nthinking about a dream life of my own.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nWell, I think that's wonderful!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nNow that you have an idea of what your dream\nis, you can start to make it real.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIt might not be that simple.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThere are parts of this dream I can't fulfill\nby myself.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nWhat else do you need?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou, Chloé.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nMe?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWhen I think about the life I want after the war,\nit feels hollow if you're not in it somewhere.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nAnd if you're the hero of your own fairy tale,\nI want to be your supporting character.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nOh my goodness...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIf you feel the same way, then I hope you'll\naccept this gift.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI saved it just for you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nThis is the Pact Ring...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou were right when you said that mine is not\nthe average person's life.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nAnd it may be a lot to ask for you to share in\nthat life, knowing it won't be ordinary.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nBut I had to know.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nYou had only to ask, \x0E\x06\x03\x00.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nI never wanted an ordinary life. The chance to\nsee myself in your story...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nI can't think of a happier ending than that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWell?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nOf course I'll wear the ring. And I'll be right\nthere, building your dream along with you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThank you, Chloé.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nToday is the opening chapter of the tale of the\nDivine One and me. A story for the ages!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
