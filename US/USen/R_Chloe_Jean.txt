MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06クロエ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ジャン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nUm...excuse me, Chloé?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nWell, hello, Jean. Did you need help\nwith something?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nNot exactly. In fact, I thought maybe I could\nhelp you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nWith what?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nI'd like you to have this stomach medicine.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nOh my! Thank you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nBut my stomach's not upset. Why did you think\nI needed medicine for it?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nWell, you eat so much weird stuff. It's only\na matter of time before it disagrees with you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nHaha! Are you worried all the folk food I eat\nwon't sit well with me?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nDon't you worry about that. I've got an\niron stomach.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nStill and all, it's good to be prepared.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nJust the other day, I saw you stuffing yourself\nwith what looked like...weird eyeballs.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nWhatever that was, there's no way it can be\nhealthy for you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nMaybe, but they're so good! I'll save some for\nyou next time, as thanks for the medicine.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nWhat?! Um, that's OK. Your thanks are enough.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nAnyway, be careful. It scares me to think of\nwhat you're putting in your body.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nSure, I'll be careful. Thanks for looking out for\nme, Jean!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06クロエ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ジャン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nHey, Jean. Would these herbs be useful?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nDefinitely! You have a good eye for this, Chloé.\nI can use those to relieve fevers.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nOh! That's good, 'cause I see a lot more\ngrowing just over there!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nThanks for your help. Go ahead and pick a few\nmore than usual.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nIt's been really nice having you out here\nwith me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nWell, your medicine has been a big help for\nall of us, so I'm happy to return the favor.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nStill, it's very kind of you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nJust be careful, OK? This part of the forest can\nget pretty dark in places.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nHuh, you're right. This is just the kind of forest\nthat feels like it could be...haAaAuUunted.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nHaunted?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nHahaha, are you scared of ghosts, Jean?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nNo. The idea of ghosts doesn't frighten me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nMost children would say that just to sound\nbrave, but...you mean it, don't you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nA ghost can't really do anything to you. No,\nwhat's much scarier to me is illness and injury.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nThings that could actually end someone's life.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nMmm... Good point.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nIn that case, we should gather more herbs so\nwe can be better prepared for those things.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nRight. Many illnesses and injuries are highly\ntreatable, if you know what to do.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nYou don't mind staying out with me a little\nlonger, do you, Chloé?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nOf course not!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06クロエ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ジャン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nHmm...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nJean? You seem pale.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nI've just been thinking...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nAbout what?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nI'm scared of losing people, Chloé.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nEvery day on the battlefield, people get hurt.\nSome even die.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nI've seen things that I could never have\nimagined back in my peaceful hometown.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nDoesn't any of this scare you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nOf course it does. And I'm sure we're not the\nonly ones.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nBut there are things we have to do, even if it\nmeans facing our fears to do them.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nThat's the thought that drives us all to fight,\nday after day. It's what drives me, at least.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nThings we have to do, even if it's scary, huh?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nI'm sure you have some too.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nI've seen you stand out on the battlefield\nwithout running from injury or death.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nI suppose so. Thank you, Chloé.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nIt probably won't ever get less scary, but that\ndoesn't mean I'll run.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nNot when I've got a steadfast friend like you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\n"Steadfast"! I like the sound of that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nBesides, you have an iron stomach, right?\nPeople like that are hard to kill.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nAlthough...if your stomach does hurt after\neating something strange, see me straightaway.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nHaha! I'm touched by your concern.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ジャン\nI mean it, OK? Seriously!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クロエ\nI won't go dying on you, Jean. Not so long as\nyou're watching out for me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
