MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06モーヴ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nラファール\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nThere. Now all that remains is to pack these up\nand put them away.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nGreetings. Do you require any assistance?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nThank you, Lord Rafal, but no. The tools are\nnow neatly organized.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nYou are planning to sort the weapons next,\nare you not? Perhaps I can assist with that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nYou need not trouble yourself.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	It seems you have something on your mind.\nCan I assist you somehow?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nI can see that my efforts to be considerate have\ncome to naught. No need to rub it in.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nNot at all. You are still new to this world. If I\ncan ease the transition in any way, I will.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nI do not require anything at the moment.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nGood. If that changes, I assume you know how\nto find me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nI would extend to you the same offer. I know\nyou have a tendency to overwork yourself.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	Try to rest now and again.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nThank you for your concern.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06モーヴ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nラファール\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nUgh... Three more trips should suffice.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nHauling crates, are we? Allow me to help you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nThe sentiment is appreciated, Lord Rafal, but\nthat is entirely unnecessary.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nWhatever you think of my appearance, I possess\nmore than adequate strength for this task.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nI am aware of that.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	Why do you seem so eager to be of assistance\nto me?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nAre my efforts to help you a nuisance?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nNo, but they are somewhat perplexing.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	Perhaps if you explained the reasoning behind\nthem, I would be more inclined to accept.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nThis appears to be difficult for you.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	I will not force the issue. When you feel inclined\nto explain, I will be ready to listen.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	For now, I will return to my work.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nUgh... I should have expected he would notice.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	I must decide how much to tell him.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	It is not an easy decision, but I ought to be\ncertain how I feel before I speak with him again.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06モーヴ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nラファール\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nMauvier. Speak with me for a moment.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nVery well. What about?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nOur conversation the other day. There is\nsomething you should know.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nIs this about why you have been so eager to be\nof assistance to me?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nYes. There was a man by the name of Mauvier\nin my world who greatly resembled you.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	I caused that man's death.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nSo this is a matter of atonement.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nThat is not what I... Ugh...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	Perhaps you have a point. This guilt I feel is a\nheavy burden.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nI am not the person you hurt, Lord Rafal, no\nmatter how much I may remind you of him.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	Regardless of your feelings, I am in no position\nto accept an apology or to offer forgiveness.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nThat is true enough. To you, my account is\nno more than the tale of a complete stranger.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nPrecisely. Anything I might offer you would\nultimately ring hollow.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	You should focus your efforts elsewhere.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nWise words.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	No amends I make to you will counteract the\nevil I have done at all.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	My paltry overtures have been nothing but a\nchildish attempt to soothe my own ego.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nIf it is any consolation, I understand how you\nfeel all too well.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	I also have a great deal for which to atone.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nI hope that you are able to do so.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nNeither of us can alter the past. The best we\ncan do is improve the future.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	If we can make the world better than it was\nbefore we damaged it, that will be a start.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nYou set a fine example. Perhaps following it will\nease my burden.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nIf that is the case, I will be glad for it.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025	Now, I have more crates to haul. Would you\nmind lending me a hand?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nCertainly.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
