MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リンデン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nAhh... HAA!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08ジェーデ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nSir Lindon? What are you doing?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nAh, Jade! Hello.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nI was just baking some pastries with thunder\nmagic. I prefer them to be a bit...thundercooked.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nOh! My, my...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nWhat is that book you're holding, I wonder?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nI've read just about every book ever written,\nbut I don't believe I recognize that cover.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nI would be amazed if you had.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nThis is one of my novels. I wrote it myself.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nOh, my stars! How wonderful! Please, you must\nlet me read it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nYou want to read my book? I'll warn you, it's a\nbit lighter in tone than you might prefer...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nSo it's a comedy, eh? I see, I see. Well...that\nonly deepens my interest.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nI could do with a refreshing rise in tone. Is there\nany way I could convince you to let me read it?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nWhat if I baked some pastries for you? Would\nthat help to seal the deal?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nNo need for that, though I appreciate the offer.\nI would be honored just to hear your thoughts.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nUnless you don't care for it, that is. Then we'll\nboth pretend we never had this conversation.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nAh! So you will let me read it? Thank you, Jade!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08ジェーデ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リンデン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nMy goodness, Jade! I do believe I nearly busted\na gut with laughter, as the saying goes.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nIt's clear that you have a considerable talent for\nwriting comedies.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nThat's high praise. Thank you, Sir Lindon.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nYour characters have so much life in them...\nThey practically leap off the page!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nHow many of them are based on real people?\nA few of our mutual friends did come to mind...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nI may have slipped in a few parallels to certain\npersons, living or dead.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nYou have a keen eye for observation and a skill\nfor capturing them on the page...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nIt was a magnificent novel, truly. I thank you\nagain for sharing your passion with me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nOf course. Thank you so much for reading it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nI have a bit of that fire myself, truth be told. I've\nchronicled my early years in a book of my own.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nYou have?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nIndeed. I haven't mentioned it to many people.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nI would love to read it, if you wouldn't\nmind sharing.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nHohoho, wonderful! I hoped you might.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nWhat a thrill it is, having a fellow writer among\nour ranks. I can hardly contain myself!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nIf and when you have the time, we should\ncompare our lists of favorite comedies.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nYes, please! I would love that!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nWhat a fortuitous meeting this has been. And\nhere I thought nothing could surprise me...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08ジェーデ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リンデン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nThis was quite a welcome surprise, Jade!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nI had hardly put your last chapter down before\nyou presented me with this new one.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nWell, now that you're reading my early drafts,\neach editing pass goes much more smoothly.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nAh, of course.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nSo? What did you think? Don't make me beg.\nBecause I will.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nIt was...magnificent.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nI enjoyed this chapter even more than the last.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nAhh, that's such a relief to hear.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nEspecially that new fellow who debuts in this\nchapter! What a pleasant addition he was.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nHe laughed, he cried... He felt truly alive! He\nmight be my new favorite character of yours.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nI must admit, I felt a certain kinship toward him.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nI'm glad to hear that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nI hope you don't think it too presumptuous of\nme, but I did model that character after you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nAha! I had a hunch! What a wonderful feeling,\nto laugh along with your fictional counterpart.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nI now take his potent zest for life as the highest\nof compliments.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nAgain, thank you for letting me read your\nmarvelous book, Jade.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nThe honor is entirely mine, I promise.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nI think I'll bake some pastries to thank you.\nYou will have some, yes?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nGlowing praise and warm pastries? Twist my\narm, why don't you. \x0E\x04\x00\x00
