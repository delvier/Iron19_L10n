MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08パネトネ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ユナカ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nZappy morning, Panette!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nGood morning, Yunaka. You seem to be in\ngood spirits. As usual.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nAlways! It's one of my redeeming qualities.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nMm-hmm. In point of fact, I have been meaning\nto ask you about that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nWhy do you insist on pretending to be cheerful\nall the time?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nYou think I'm acting? You think I'm so talented,\nI can keep it up all the time? I-I'm flattered!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nAh-ah-ah. Do not bluff a bluffer.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nI can tell that this is not your true manner.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nWhen I began serving the boss, I had to swap\nout my own dialect for a more proper one.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nSince then, I have had a keen ear for others'\nfalse tongues.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nTakes one to know one, doesn't it...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nI can't answer your question, though.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nIf I spoiled the mystery, who would you harass\nwith prying questions? My hands are tied.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nHm. So be it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nForgive me for probing.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nBut this duplicity... Somehow it does not sit\nright with me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nUh huh...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08パネトネ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ユナカ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nYunaka, I cannot help but wonder about\nyour past.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nI understand wanting to preserve some secrecy.\nBut please...tell me a little about it, won't you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nOK...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nMy parents abandoned me when I was small.\nAfter that, growing up was anything but easy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nI don't like thinking about it. And I like talking\nabout it even less.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nI am so sorry.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nI know well the pain of being neglected by\none's parents.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nYou too? Really?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nAlas, yes. My father was a hopeless drunk.\nMy mother was always out partying.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nWho knew that we hailed from such similar\nbackgrounds?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nI wouldn't have guessed. But it's reassuring,\nin a way. Maybe I feel a little less alone.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nHm?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nBandits. Incoming on our position.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nI count...nine. No─ten.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nThought they could get the jump on us, eh?\nWe'll show them.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nListen up, pinheads! If I was you, I'd think twice\nabout messing with me and her!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nOne more step and we'll turn your intestines\ninto outtestines! Got it?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nWe're not here to kill anyone.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nBut if you're here to be killed, well... My hands\nare tied.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08パネトネ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ユナカ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nHear that? Could be more bandits.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nOh? You goons back for seconds?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nHa! Ain't often I meet bandits who whine like\nkitty cats!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nOh, no no no, hold up. That actually was a cat.\nTricksy little hairball set me on edge!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nOh! Right you are. What a relief!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nI must say, Yunaka, I rather enjoy that vicious\ndemeanor you adopt during combat.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nI could say the same about you! You're usually\nso polite, but you really let 'em have it!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nYes. In moments of danger, I sometimes feel my\nblood boil as it used to.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nI know the feeling. I slip into my old ways\nsometimes too. As you saw.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nWe do have a lot in common, don't we? But...\nLet's keep this our little secret.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nIndeed. Which reminds me... I apologize for\nneedling you about the way you speak.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nReally, it was quite conceited of me. Glass\nhouses and all that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nI get it. Some good came out of it, though.\nI learned my act needs work, for one thing.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nWe could practice together, perhaps?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nZappy! Great idea!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nUm, you know, I have always meant to ask...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nWhat is this "zappy" business all about?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nOh. Well, uh...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nYes?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nThat's another one of my mysteries! Wouldn't\nwanna spoil it until we know each other better.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nAh! In that case, you give me no choice.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nI shall see to it that we become the very best\nof friends!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
