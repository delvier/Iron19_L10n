MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08パネトネ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08パンドロ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nHello, Pandreo. Have you a moment to spare?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nOf course! I always have time for my sister.\nBut first you've gotta tone down the formality.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nAh, all right. You see, there's something I've\nbeen meaning to ask you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nNope, nope. You're still speaking in that\nhighfalutin way.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nYou don't really expect me to─\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nYes, I do. I know you make an effort to sound\nfancy, but come on. It's only me here.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nYou can drop the silver-spoon act around your\nown brother.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nFine. Why are you working for the church?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nThat's what you wanted to know, huh?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nDad was a drunk. Mom was a corrupt priest\nwho couldn't be bothered to look after her kids.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nThey were lousy parents.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nSo why would you wanna follow in their\nfootsteps─serve their church?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nI told you what happened after you left, right?\nThey disappeared.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nYeah. So?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nWell, the church's followers needed someone to\nguide them.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nThat's why I stepped in.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nHmph. So that's what it was.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nI know it's been a while, but if you'd like to\ncome pray with us, you're always welcome.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nNo. I think I'll pass.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nI'm done with our parents, and I'm done with\ntheir church.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nI'd sooner drop dead than step foot in that\nplace again.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nFair enough.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08パネトネ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08パンドロ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nHow come you've never told me off for running\naway from home?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nWhy would I? I was glad you got out when\nyou did.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nHuh. I always imagined you'd hold a grudge\nagainst me for flying the coop.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nNah. I just wasn't brave enough to do likewise.\nWasn't sure I could make it alone.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nMeanwhile, look at you. A retainer! You struck\nout on your own and made a life for yourself.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nI'll bet those parents of ours would be glad to\nsee how well you're doing.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nI doubt it. They probably don't care about me\none way or another.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nListen. I probably shouldn't tell you this, but I'm\nnot one to keep secrets.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nMom and Dad tried to find you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nWhat?! Wolfdung... There's no way.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nI was surprised too.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nMaybe they were just concerned about...\nkeeping up appearances. Hard to say.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nAt any rate, that's the truth. I figured you\nshould know.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nWhat am I supposed to do with that?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08パンドロ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08パネトネ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nHey, brother. You praying?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nYes. I'm glad to see you showing your face here.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nI've got so many bad memories of this place\nthat I really didn't want to.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nBut this isn't our parents' church anymore.\nIt's yours.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nSo I figured it might be all right to stop by─\njust for a few minutes.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nWell, it's great to have you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nYeah. So, um... Guess I'll pray real quick.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nI prayed for peace.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nAnd while I was at it...I prayed that our parents\nare OK. Wherever they are.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nGood for you, Panette.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nWhat do you think they're doing right now?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nNo idea. To be honest, I have a feeling\nthey're dead.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nBut who knows? Maybe we'll find them\nsomeday, just like you and I found each other.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nNow that we're adults and we have a little\ndistance from...everything that happened...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nI'd like to think we could sit them down and\nhave an honest-to-goodness conversation.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nThat would be nice.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nI think they'd be proud of us. Of you, especially.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nPanette, listen. I need you to survive this war.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nI... I can't bear to lose any more of my family.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nDuh. I'm not gonna go dying on you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nIn fact, I'll do you one better. I'll save your\npriestly hide too.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パンドロ\nHaha, glad to hear it. With the fearsome Panette\nprotecting me, I know I'll be all right.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nYou know it! You and me, we're gonna survive\nthis thing together.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
