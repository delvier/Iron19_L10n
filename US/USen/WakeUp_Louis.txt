MID_WU_C_1_IN_#001	Pardon the intrusion, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#001	Greetings.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#002	I am glad you're awake. I could not bear to\ndisturb you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#003	I'll take my leave.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#001	I'm only here to make certain you wake. I hope\nthat's all right.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#002	No need to hurry. I'll admire the view while\nI wait.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#003	Ah, look at the gardens. And all those\nfascinating people...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#001	Awake now, are you? Splendid.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#002	Now that I've fulfilled my duty here...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#003	I'll take a stroll through the gardens. Farewell.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#001	Morning has come.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#002	I suppose it will take more than saying so to\nwake you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#001	You're awake already?! But I haven't yet made\nthe tea!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#002	I was concerned it would get cold. What a fool\nI've been...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#001	Although...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#002	I feel I am not the ideal person to be doing this.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#003	Surely the Divine Dragon should be tended to\nby someone more important...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#001	Yes...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#002	A monarch would be appropriate, or at least\na royal...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#003	Ah! Divine One! How long have you\nbeen awake?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#001	Who would be the ideal person to wake the\nDivine Dragon?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#001	Oh. I was wondering who would be best to\nwake you up...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#002	but it appears such a service is not required at\nall. Good morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#001	If I can't think of the person...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#002	I'll have to envision one.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#003	A gallant knight...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#004	strong, courteous, and kind...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#001	Oh, Divine One. Good morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#002	I was just, ah...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#003	Apologies.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#004	But you caught me in the midst of a daydream.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#001	This is far less trying than waking my\nyounger brothers.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#001	You wake much more readily...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#002	than my family at home.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#003	Thank you for making my job so easy. That is\nvery considerate.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#001	With three brothers, one must be quite stern.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#002	I would oft be moved to words like...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#003	"Get up now or there shall be no breakfast\nleft for you!"\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#001	I see that motivated you quite effectively.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#002	Very interesting.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#003	In that case, please enjoy the breakfast I've\nprepared without delay.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#001	If I am correct about this...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#001	As I thought...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#002	you're already up.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#003	I brought tea.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#004	It's quite a rare blend, flavored with the grapes\nof my hometown.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#001	Since we each take our turns waking the\nDivine Dragon...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#002	that means...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#003	Heh, I can observe a plethora of people merely\nby waiting around here!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#001	Good morning. I had a wonderful idea just now.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#002	Alas, it would require me to stand watch at\nall hours. I must refrain.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#001	My brothers will be very interested to read\nabout this waking-up ritual.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#001	Oh, did you hear that?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#002	Of course I mentioned you in my letter.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#003	I told them you are an impressively early riser.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#001	You advised me to write what I feel in my letter.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#002	And since you are such a large part of my life...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#003	that turned out to mean writing a great deal\nabout you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#001	Would you like to meet my brothers someday?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#002	I'm certain they would love to meet you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#003	To see all of you gathered together would be...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#004	deeply moving.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#001	No matter how often I come by to wake you up,\nit always makes me a touch nervous.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#001	You rose so suddenly!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#002	I've gotten used to watching you from afar...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#003	but I'm still unaccustomed to just how close\nwe've become.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#001	I must say, it still doesn't feel quite real...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#002	that you gave me the Pact Ring.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#003	When I think of it, I feel as if I'm slipping away...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#004	into another one of my daydreams.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#005	That's how much you mean to me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#006	My heart swells with happiness whenever\nI think of you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#001	You're up. How may I serve you this morning?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#002	What? Of course it isn't odd for me to be asking\nyou that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#003	Nothing fulfills me more...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#004	than taking care of you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#001	It's morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#002	Will you be rising early today or sleeping in?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#001	Haha, in a hurry to get up, are you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#002	No need to rush. I'm not going anywhere.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#003	I intend to remain by your side until the end\nof my days.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#001	So you'd like to rest a while longer? I expected\nas much.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#002	You're still wearing my ring.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#003	You must never take it off.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#004	For my part, I'm still getting used to seeing it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#005	It feels rather like a dream to me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#006	But of all the dreams I've had in my life...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#007	this is the one I'd want most to come true.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#001	Good, you're awake.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#002	I've so much more to say.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#003	Shall we continue this conversation over a\nlovely cup of tea?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#004	What do you think?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
