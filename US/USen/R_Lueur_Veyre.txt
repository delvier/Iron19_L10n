MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08ヴェイル\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nHmm...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nVeyle...why are you looking at me like that?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nI just... Are you really OK?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI really am. I mean, it was strange...taking\nCorrupted form and waking up from that...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nBut I'm fine now. And it's all thanks to\nyou, Veyle.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nI'm relieved.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nI... I also wanted to apologize for everything\nI've done. Everything I did in the past.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nSo many people died. And it's because of me.\nI was too weak. It's my fault they're dead.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nI know I can't be forgiven, not completely. But if\nyou could, even just a little... I'm so sorry.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOh, Veyle. It wasn't your fault. The Fell Dragon\nwas controlling you. He's to blame─not you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou say you're weak, but it was your strength\nthat freed you from him. That's impressive.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nThank you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nI'll get stronger too. Like I said before, I want to\nbe a dragon like you─ready to save the world.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nAnd I'll do everything in my power to make\nthat happen. I just hope...you'll help me?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nAbsolutely. That's what a big brother is for.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015_F	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nAbsolutely. That's what a big sister is for.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'll do anything I can to help you. It's the least\nI can do to make up for not being around.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nDon't worry. I'm right beside you, little sister.\nWe can do this together.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nYes, we can.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08ヴェイル\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nDo you remember when you gave me\nthe dragonstone?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI wish I could say I did... But everything from\nbefore I woke up is hazy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nWell, you and I met just one time, a thousand\nyears ago.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003_F	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nWell, you and I met just one time, a thousand\nyears ago.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWe only met once?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nMm-hmm.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nAll of our siblings had died in the war.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nYou were the only one to survive, and you\ncame to see me.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007_F	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nYou were the only one to survive, and you\ncame to see me.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nI was very young then─frail and frightened─\nand you handed me the dragonstone.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nYou told me that you couldn't stay by my side\nbut that you were still with me no matter what.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOh, so I said that to you...all that time ago...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nYou did. The dragonstone is shattered, but it\nwas my protective talisman for a very long time.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nI held it close when Mama died and when Papa\nreturned and said horrible things to me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nI knew that as long as I had the dragonstone,\nI could be strong...and hold on until I saw you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nVeyle, I...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nEven if you can't remember what you did,\nI am still so grateful.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nIf you hadn't given me the dragonstone, we\nnever would have found each other again.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'm grateful too. To think you held me in your\nheart all those years...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWithout you, Veyle, I wouldn't be standing here\nright now.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nNow that we're reunited, we'll be together\nforever, right?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThat's right. Nothing can separate us ever again.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08ヴェイル\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nHehe, I had so much fun today!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nSo this is what it feels like to have family.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nVeyle, there's...something I'd like to ask you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHow do you feel about our father? About\nSombron?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nOh...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nSoon we'll have to face him. Not as his children,\nbut as his enemies. So...I had to ask.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nYes...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nPapa hurt so many people in the past. And now\nhe's doing it again. He is...evil.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nHe's never shown me kindness. I'm not sure he\nthinks of me at all.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nStill...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nHe is family, just like you. So I can't hate\nhim entirely.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011_F	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nHe is family, just like you. So I can't hate\nhim entirely.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI understand.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nSometimes I just wish I could be part of a happy\nfamily. But I know that's a silly dream.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nAt the very least, I hope I can stop Papa before\nhe hurts anyone else.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nNo, I will stop him.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nSo, that is how I feel about our father.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThank you for telling me, Veyle. I feel the same.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThe time for reconciliation is long past. I will\nuse all of my power to stop Sombron.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nBut I won't be able to do it without you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nDon't worry. You and me and the rest of our\nfriends...we'll stop him together.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020_F	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nDon't worry. You and me and the rest of our\nfriends...we'll stop him together.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOK. Let's do this, Veyle. Then, when it's all\nover, our future can truly begin.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nYes. For our future.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08ヴェイル\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nThere you are! I have something I want to\ngive you.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001_F	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08ヴェイル\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nThere you are! I have something I want to\ngive you.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOh?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nIt's for you! I hope you love it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWhat a beautiful stone! It's so clear and blue.\nYou went looking for it, just for me?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nI did. I wanted to give you something in return\nfor the dragonstone you gave me so long ago.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nI've poured all of my energy into it so, if we\nget separated again, we can find each other.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWe really are siblings, it seems.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nWhat do you mean?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nVeyle, I also have something I'd like to give you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nThis is...the Pact Ring!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYes. It's for you, Veyle. You're my dear sister\nand the person most precious to me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nBut...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI can't imagine giving this ring to anyone else.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nI can't accept this. This is very special to you,\nDivine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nI'm the one who took Lumera's life! I don't\ndeserve it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThat's not true. You do deserve it, and I want\nyou to have it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nBesides, I know Mother would want this. She\nwould want both of us to be happy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nNo matter what.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nI understand. I will take it, then.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nYou gave me the dragonstone and I made it my\ntalisman. This ring─it will be my new one.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThat makes me happy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI know how much the dragonstone meant to\nyou. I hoped this could replace it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nNo, not so much replace it...more like symbolize\nsomething new─our bond as siblings.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOf course, I had no idea you'd go and give me a\npretty stone before I could give you this ring!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nI'm glad I did. I like that we think so similarly.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou gave me the stone so that we'd always be\nable to find each other...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#028	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nBut I'm not going anywhere, Veyle. You and\nI are family, and we're sticking together.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#029	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nThe ring and the stone...they can remind us\nthat we never have to be apart again.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#030	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nOK, let's win this war and bring peace to the\nworld...for Lumera. She would like that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#031	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYes, she would. And we can do it together.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#032	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ヴェイル\nI swear on this ring... I'll stand by your side and\nbe a dragon who's ready to save the world.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
