MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06モーヴ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nマデリーン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nHello... Do you have a moment to speak?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nMar...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	No. You must be Madeline.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nYes, that's right.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	And you are Mauvier.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nYes.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nUmm...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nDid you need something?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nPardon me. I only wanted to say hello and\nformally introduce myself.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	Being from a different world, I'm sure I have\nmuch to learn about yours.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	But I'm pleased to make your acquaintance, and\nI look forward to fighting for victory together.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nYour warm greeting is noted.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	In fact, I was hoping you and I would have a\nchance to speak. Thank you for coming to me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nOh, no thanks needed. It's custom for a junior\nknight to greet her betters.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nBetters? I saw how you fought in the last battle,\ncleaving through enemy ranks with ease.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	It's clear to me you are a brave, capable knight.\nWell done, Madeline.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nOh... Um...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018	Thank you. That's very kind.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019	But really, there's no need for such praise.\nI am a knight, sworn to protect my allies.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nSo that's how you are. Wonderful.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nI... Um...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nApologies. You doubtless have many more\npeople to greet. I will take my leave.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nBut wait! Mauvier...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#024	Oh...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#025	How strange it is, speaking to Mauvier again.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#026	But am I imagining things? I got this\ncurious feeling...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#027	It felt like he was looking at me, but speaking to\nsomeone else.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06モーヴ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nマデリーン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nEvery last piece of equipment has been\ninspected. Time for a break, I think.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nYes, you certainly deserve one.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nSince you organized everything beforehand,\nthe work went rather quickly.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	Really, that was a tremendous help. Well done.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nI'm just happy to be of service.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nDividing the items by size and type was a\nsmart touch. You have a mind for logistics.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	And it must have been no mean feat, sorting\nsuch a large stockpile. Your efforts are noted.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nIt was nothing, really! I just... Oh dear.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	I don't know how to say this, so I'll just come\nout with it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nHm? Is something the matter?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nYou seem to praise me a lot.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	I appreciate the recognition but, as I've said,\nit's really not needed.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nRight. You did say that, didn't you...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nI may be imagining things, but...when you praise\nme, it feels as if you're praising someone else.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nSo it's true, then. You're not praising me.\nNot really.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	I am no one else's stand-in, Mauvier.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nRight you are... Apologies.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	Without meaning to, I was conflating you with\nsomeone else.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	I suppose I wanted to give her what I had failed\nto offer before... Nonsensical as that may seem.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nHer?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nIn any case, I apologize. I will endeavor to make\nit up to you...in time. Excuse me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nMaybe I shouldn't have said that.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024	After all, he's not alone in conflating one person\nwith another... I am too.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025	Now I understand why Lady Nel treated\nthe Divine Dragon so coldly.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026	...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#027	I should try to see this Mauvier as the person\nhe is...not the person he reminds me of.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06モーヴ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nマデリーン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nMadeline.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nMauvier! Hello...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nI owe you an apology. I am sorry for making\nyou uncomfortable.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nNonsense... I'm the one who went too far.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	I had no right to criticize you for mixing me up\nwith another person.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	After all...I was doing the same thing to you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nYou were?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nI...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nApologies... I will say my piece first. That\nseems proper.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	I had not intended to tell you this, but it seems\nI must...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	The you of this world is dead.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nWhat?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nThe person I conflated you with... Her name\nwas Marni.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	I fought by her side many times. She was a\nfrank person who delighted in praise.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	And I... I failed to protect her. I watched her die.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nThat's also what happened to you... I mean, the\nMauvier from my world.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	I failed to protect him, and he died. I guess you\ncould say we lost each other.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nYes... Still, I know you are not Marni. I will not\ncome to you for her forgiveness.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nAnd I will not give you the apology I owe\nmy Mauvier.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	Nor will I cry and cling to you...and voice the\nfeelings I'd meant to express to him.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	I'm just glad to see you are alive and well\nin this world.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	Even if I'm not.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nI feel the same... It brings me comfort to know\nthere is a world in which you survived.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	I wish you the greatest happiness.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nThank you, Mauvier.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nI promise, I will never again conflate you and\nMarni. You have my word.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027	Standing before me, I see none other than the\nbrave knight Madeline.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028	The words of praise I give you are yours,\nand no one else's.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nI appreciate that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nIn truth, though, I do not praise people often...\nYou may not hear much of it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nAll the better. I don't need praise.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#032	Then again, earning yours might be an enticing\nchallenge... I'll be sure to train enough that I do.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#033	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nHm. Very well. I am glad that we see each other\nas we are.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#034	Now we can truly become friends... Here's to\ndominating the battlefield together.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#035	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nマデリーン\nYes, Mauvier. I'm going to make you proud.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
