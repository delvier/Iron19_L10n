MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nJust doing a bit of fortune telling. The cards say\nthat a man foretold by legend will soon appear.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アンバー\nWhoa! A man foretold by legend? Where?\nWhen? What else do the cards say?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nWell, this legendary man is young, gregarious,\nenergetic...and rather handsome.\x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nAh, but he's also a fool.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アンバー\nOh. That can't be me, then. Heh, poor Greg...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nHmm... This fabled fellow also has a powerful\nconnection to a certain animal. The...alpaca?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アンバー\nAlpacas?! No way! That has to be me. I AM the\nlegendary Greg!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nYou're the figure my cards are heralding?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アンバー\nI guess so! But what does that mean? Am I\nsupposed to do something?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nWell, according the cards, sometime in the near\nfuture, you are going to be a savior. \x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アンバー\nHow near is this near future going to be?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nEh, that remains a bit...foggy. But never fear,\nI'll give you a shout as soon as things are clear.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アンバー\nGot it. I'll keep my ears perked up and my eyes\npointed in both directions...just like an alpaca!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08アンバー\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08セアダス\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nAh, it's the alpaca-loving savior himself.\nYou made it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アンバー\nHmm. I know you mean that, but the way you\nsay it makes me sound...uncool.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nWell, how's this for cool... According to the\ncards, today is the day you become a savior!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アンバー\nReally? Today?! That's great!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アンバー\nSo, uh...what should I do?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nMake it rain.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アンバー\nHah, uh...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アンバー\nMake it rain? Like, actual rain? From the sky?\nHow do I do that?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nThat...I do not know. I'm not the savior. You are.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アンバー\nOh, come on! You can't just make rain happen.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nLook, if you're the savior of legend, then you\nshould be able to do it. So sayeth the cards.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アンバー\nWow. The cards really believe in me that much?\nI can't let them down.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アンバー\nRight. OK. No big deal. I'm a legendary savior.\nI already have everything I need to make it rain.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アンバー\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アンバー\nHow was that? Is it raining yet?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nNot a single drop.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アンバー\nOh, come on!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI guess...the fortune was off. I'm sorry.\nI thought I had it right.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アンバー\nNo, you're fine. I'm the one who just made a\nfool of himself. Tell your cards I'm sorry...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08アンバー\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08セアダス\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nAmber, can I have a word with you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アンバー\nI'm still pretty embarrassed about that whole\n"rain savior" thing. I really am a fool.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nThat's what I wanted to talk to you about.\nIt rained. You're a savior after all!\x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アンバー\nI appreciate you trying to make me feel better...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アンバー\nBut that kind of coddling just makes me feel like\neven more of a fool.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI wouldn't do that. I'm telling you, Amber... You\nmade it rain─just like the cards said you would.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nIt didn't rain right where we were standing, but\nit did rain in a village just a few miles away.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アンバー\nIt did?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nIt hadn't rained there for ages. In fact, the crops\nwere on the verge of turning to dust.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nThen all of a sudden, it started pouring.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI'm telling you, it happened right after you\nfinished that weird rain chant of yours.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アンバー\nWhoa. What? No. Really? I did that? Really?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\n"Hear ye, humble townsfolk. Come, meet your\nalpaca-loving savior!" Yep, that's what I'll say.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アンバー\nNo, don't say it like that! You're making me\nsound uncool again.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nDon't worry. I promise to properly introduce\nthe "man foretold by legend." You deserve it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アンバー\nYes! And when you do, I'll thank the genius\nfortune-teller that predicted me!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nHaha, now it's my turn to be embarrassed.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アンバー\nWe make a pretty good duo, y'know?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI don't think we have a choice. According to\nmy latest reading, we're destined to be friends.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アンバー\nHah! Man, those cards are so smart.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08アンバー\nHere's to a budding friendship. Nothing's gonna\nrain on our parade! Uh, unless I make it, that is.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
