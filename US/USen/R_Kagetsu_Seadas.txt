MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06カゲツ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nHello, Seadall. What are you doing?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI'm honing my divination powers using a\nTarot deck.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nWhile I'm best known for my dancing, I'm also\nskilled at fortune telling.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nAlready you excel, and yet you remain in\ncontinual practice. You are very dedicated.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI have my reasons...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nI see.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダスAs long as I'm practicing, I could give your\nfortune a read, Kagetsu.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nOh, no need. I already have this ability.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nI will demonstrate! Ahem...prepare yourself!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nSoon you will be eating...sliced meats layered\nbetween two breads!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nYes, that's right. But how did you...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nI told you. It is my ability to see the future.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nYou can just...see the future?! Could you show\nme how?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nI am surprised you are so interested! Alas,\nmy power cannot be taught.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nI was born with this gift. I did not acquire it\nby learning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nBut it is cooling fans in winter, as they say.\nUseless. I get only inconsequential details.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI see.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nEh, it sounds like I should probably focus on my\nown divination skills.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06カゲツ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08セアダス\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nSeadall! I have glimpsed your future again. Your\nperformance this evening will be well attended!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nNo need for your skills on that front. My\nperformances are always packed full.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nI can also see that it will rain tonight. Be sure\nto prepare for your walk home.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nThat does seem fairly obvious, Kagetsu. Rain\nclouds just rolled in.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nYou see? Useful as cooling fans in winter.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nYour premonitions really do seem to be for the\nmost useless things.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nIf this power of yours was only a bit more...\napplicable...I'm sure I'd be quite envious.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nNo need to envy abilities like mine when you\ncan read fortunes.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nMy fortune-telling skills are well-regarded,\nsure... But sadly, they aren't perfect.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nWhy do you say so?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nMy master...the one who taught me to dance...\nhe was attacked and killed by thieves.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nIf my divination skills had been perfect, I would\nhave seen it coming. I could have saved him.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nSo, I keep honing my skills in hopes I don't ever\nhave to experience that kind of regret again.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nPerhaps you would read my fortune, then.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nYour fortune?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nYes! You said that you wish to sharpen\nyour skills.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nI would gladly serve as your training partner.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nThat would be very helpful. Thank you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nThink nothing of it!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nWell then, let's see what fate has in store\nfor you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nKagetsu, as the fog of destiny parts to reveal\nwhat lies ahead, I see...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nOh no!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nIt's La Mort...the Death card. And it's in the\nupright position.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nIt means misfortune awaits you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nWhat?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06カゲツ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08セアダス\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nThat was terribly close!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nKagetsu! What happened?! Was it...misfortune?\nWas the card right?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nI did not realize...there were bear dens near my\ntraining ground!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nBut...there's not a mark on you. You seem\nperfectly fine.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nWhat a relief! I suppose my divination\nwas wrong.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nNo... No, it was right!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nWhat?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nI was prepared for misfortune. As soon as one\nbear came toward me, I quickly fled.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nWithout your prediction, I would have trained as\nnormal and failed to notice until too late.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nSo...my fortune telling saved you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nIndeed, Seadall, it saved my life. Thank you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nNo. Thank you, Kagetsu. This has given me\nmore confidence in my divination skills.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nGood. Phew! This rubbing elbows with death\nhas made me hungry.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nJust now I caught some glimpse of you and I\nsitting down to eat.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI'm sure your premonition is right. In fact, I bet\nyour vision showed us eating sandwiches.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nMeat between two breads─how did you know?!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nWell, as it happens, I had just decided to treat\nyou to a meal.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nAh! This gives me another vision─one in which\nour friendship blooms.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nHa! No need for divination there. We're already\nfriends.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
