MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08ジェーデ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06カゲツ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nJade! Face me! Show me your skill in battle!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nNo, thanks. I'll pass.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nSo quick to turn me aside! Why?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nI have heard your strength has won you\ntournament victories in Brodia.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nSuch strength is meant to be shown and used.\nDo not keep it to yourself!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nI didn't receive orders to engage you. I have no\npersonal grudge against you. Why fight?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nJade, Jade, Jade. You disappoint me!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nWhat I hear of your skill is so exciting! Please,\nI must see it for myself!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nHow can I earn the favor of this bout? I will do\nanything you ask.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nAnything?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nIn that case...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nWould you be willing to answer a few personal\nquestions before we battle?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nHeh, easily. May I ask why?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nI need to round out a character for a new book\nI'm outlining. You can help me fill in the gaps.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nI need only talk about myself?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nThat's right. And it sounds like we have a deal.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08ジェーデ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06カゲツ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nI come from Pale Sands, which is located on\nSolm's northeastern frontier.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nMy home is not commonly visited by outsiders.\nIts culture is precious and unique.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nWhat was different about it? Any examples\ncome to mind?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nMy clothing, for a start. It must seem different\nto your eye.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nOur architecture as well. You will not see finer\nwoodworking anywhere.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nWe also worship differently. We do not revere\nDivine or Fell Dragons.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nWe have other dragons. They are long and lithe.\nI have not seen them in other countries.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nHm! Interesting. I'd like to see that myself.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nI can show you pictures in scrolls. But you must\nagree to another duel with me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nWe haven't had our first duel yet! Now, let me\nget through all of my questions.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nWhat can you tell me about your family?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nApart from my parents, I have one younger\nbrother and one younger sister.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nAh. You're the firstborn, then?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nYes. It was my parents' intention for me\nto carry on our family's legacy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nI was...unable to do this, however.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nI could not bear to live all of my days without\never knowing the world at large.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nOh?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nYes. It was for that reason I decided to leave.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nI left written words behind to explain my\nintentions, and to ask them not to look for me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nAnd so I left, and here I am.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nThat's an amazing backstory, Kagetsu. Your life\nis like an adventure novel that writes itself.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nWe each have our stories.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nNow, will you indulge me in that duel?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nSure. I'm out of questions, and a deal is a deal,\nso...I'm ready when you are.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08ジェーデ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06カゲツ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nYour strength is incredible! I have never been\nso cornered by my opponent!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nYou put up quite a fight yourself. I can't believe\nwe ended with a draw.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nIt is rare I take pleasure in stalemates.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nIt was satisfying, wasn't it?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nTell me, Jade, how did you develop such\nstrength? Does it come from your family?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nNot at all. My upbringing was rather peaceful\nand quiet, actually.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nMy father is a gemologist, and my mother is an\nartisan. She makes the most beautiful jewelry...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nSo they are untrained in battle.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nThat's right. When I was younger, I helped my\nmother with her work.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nUnfortunately, I turned out to be all thumbs...so\nI eventually took a job guarding our local mine.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nThis change is quite sudden.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nIs it? It didn't feel that sudden. I've always\nenjoyed physical tasks.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nBandits would keep trying to steal from that\nmine...so I got plenty of exercise. Fun times.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nAh. Now I understand.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nI guarded that mine for years and years... Folks\nin town started calling me the "Iron Wall."\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nEventually a royal soldier heard about me and\nsuggested I enter Brodia's fighting tournament.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nAnd you won it straightaway, I'd imagine.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nI fought my way to the top spot, met Prince\nDiamant, and officially became his retainer.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nWhoops. I meant to ask you more questions, but\nI ended up going on and on about my own past.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nI guess it's just like you said, Kagetsu. We each\nhave our stories...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nIndeed. And now that our tapestries interweave,\nthey point us toward our shared future.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nLike turning the pages of a novel.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06カゲツ\nPrecisely! So when will we have our rematch?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nJust name a place and time, and I'll be there.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08ジェーデ\nI can already tell that, in the novel of my life,\nour duels are sure to be pages worth rereading.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
