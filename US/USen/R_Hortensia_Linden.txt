MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x12\x0Cオルテンシア\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リンデン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cオルテンシア\nHey, Lindon! My sister's asking for you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nAh, thank you, Princess Hortensia. So sorry to\nhave made you fetch me like this.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cオルテンシア\nThat's OK─I had a thing to do and you were on\nthe way. Oh, that's a pretty painting!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cオルテンシア\nThe lady's beautiful... Is she your daughter?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nThis lovely painting is of my even lovelier wife.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cオルテンシア\nYeah, she's a vision. You're a lucky guy!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nIf she were here now, I'm sure she would be\ndelighted to hear you say so.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cオルテンシア\nYou'll have to introduce us next time she's\naround. I'd love to meet her.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nUnfortunately, that will not be possible...\nShe passed away some time ago.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cオルテンシア\nOh... Oh no. I had no idea. I'm so sorry.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nHm-hm, it's quite all right, Princess Hortensia.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nWe raised three children together. They're all\ngrown now, off living lives of their own.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nI've had mages to train and keep me company,\nand I'm sure she's at peace in the hereafter.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cオルテンシア\nYou've accomplished so much. I'm sure if she\nwere here, she'd say she's very proud.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cオルテンシア\nSay, Lindon... Would you consider giving me\nsome lessons? I could learn a lot from you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nI'm flattered that you would suggest the idea...\nbut I think it best for us both that I decline.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cオルテンシア\nHow come?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nI simply don't have the stamina to\nteach anymore.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cオルテンシア\nI understand. You've still got battles to fight.\nI shouldn't trouble you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nDon't fret! I'm sure there's a spry spellcaster\nout there who would make the perfect tutor.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x12\x0Cオルテンシア\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リンデン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cオルテンシア\nLindon, can we talk?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cオルテンシア\nI was hoping you might...reconsider giving me\nsome lessons.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nAs I said before, Princess Hortensia, I don't\nhave the energy for teaching anymore.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nBesides, I've heard that you're already top of\nthe class in the Elusian Academy, are you not?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nThere's no reason to rush your education.\nTake the time to grow.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cオルテンシア\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cオルテンシア\nMy father didn't live long enough to see me\nmake it on my own.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cオルテンシア\nThat's why I'm in a rush. I don't want any\nmore regrets like that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nAh, of course.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cオルテンシア\nI want my father to rest knowing I can take care\nof myself─like your children do.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cオルテンシア\nYou can help me with that, can't you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nI understand you, truly. But...I have further\nreasons to decline.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cオルテンシア\nWhat do you mean?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nSince King Hyacinth's abrupt passing, Elusia\nhas been gripped in a moment of crisis.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nIn a time such as this, even a minor incident\ncould upset the balance of our kingdom.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nTo protect my beloved Elusia, I must dedicate\nall of my strength to our reconstruction efforts.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nUnder these conditions, I simply do not have\nany time to devote to you, Princess Hortensia.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cオルテンシア\nSo that's why Ivy was asking for you...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cオルテンシア\nI'm sorry, Lindon. I was being selfish.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cオルテンシア\nI was thinking only of my own education, while\nyou and Ivy are both hard at work for Elusia.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nNo, no. You have nothing to apologize for.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nThere's no fault in looking out for yourself,\nPrincess Hortensia.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cオルテンシア\nMaybe you're right. Thanks.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cオルテンシア\nI am still a princess of Elusia, though. Let me\nknow if there's anything I can do to help.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x12\x0Cオルテンシア\x021\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cオルテンシア\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cオルテンシア\nWhat can I do for Elusia?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cオルテンシア\nWhat can I do, Father? Help me...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リンデン\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nIf he were here, I'm sure King Hyacinth would\nsay that you already serve our kingdom well.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cオルテンシア\nLindon...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cオルテンシア\nHow can you be so sure? My father's...gone.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cオルテンシア\nIvy was always the model daughter, but I...\nI was more of a pain.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cオルテンシア\nWhen I imagine him looking down on me, all\nI see on his face is disappointment.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nI was originally a retainer to the king's older\nbrother─your uncle. I think you knew that...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nAt that time...I did not think kindly of\nKing Hyacinth.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cオルテンシア\nReally? I had no idea.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nThere was a scrabble for succession, with your\nuncle openly opposing your father's claim.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nIn the end, the elder brother lost the battle for\nthe throne...and soon abandoned the country.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nI had argued passionately in favor of your uncle,\nso I resented your father right out of the gates.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nBut then, one day, he turned to me and said,\n"Lindon, you serve our kingdom well."\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cオルテンシア\nAh...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nI didn't know what to make of that. He and I\nwere supposed to be enemies!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nThen I realized that he meant it. In uncertain\ntimes, we both cared deeply for Elusia's safety.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nThat's why I can confidently speak for him and\nsay...you serve our kingdom well.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cオルテンシア\nThat means a lot to me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nWhat's more, a parent always loves their child.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nKing Hyacinth could never be disappointed in\nyou, Princess Hortensia.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nI've raised three children to your nil, so if I say\nit's true...you have no room to argue.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cオルテンシア\nOK, OK. Consider me convinced.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cオルテンシア\nI really do feel much better now. Thank you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cオルテンシア\nI'm going to keep taking care of myself─and\nkeep doing my best. I'll make Father proud.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nThat's it. That's the spirit.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nI may lack time, but I'm never short on words of\nadvice. If you ever need to talk, I will listen.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リンデン\nYou're a fine, accomplished young woman.\nI'm eager to see what else you become.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cオルテンシア\nI'll make you proud too, Lindon.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
