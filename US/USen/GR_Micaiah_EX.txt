MID_GR_El_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nHe is still your brother, even if there is little\nresemblance. Or have I missed some nuance?\x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_GR_El_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ミカヤ\nSomething like that, yes. He was like a little\nbrother until he was bigger than me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_GR_El_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nAs a dragon, I understand this very well.\nIt is sad to watch the little ones grow old.\x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_GR_Rafale_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nA failure? What is this nonsense? Did you not\ncare for a younger sibling in your own world?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_GR_Rafale_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ミカヤ\nIn a manner of speaking. He found me─sought\nme out. I always wondered why he did that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_GR_Rafale_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nラファール\nIt is no mystery. You were important to him.\nElder siblings are not the only ones who care.\x0E\x04\x00\x00

MID_GR_Selestia_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ミカヤ\nThe king was very gentle, and put his people\nabove all else. I worried that he was too soft.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_GR_Selestia_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ミカヤ\nThat's the downside to kindness. In a time of\npeace, I'm sure he'd be revered as a wise king.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
