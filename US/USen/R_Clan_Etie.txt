MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06クラン\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nエーティエ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nエーティエ\nPhew. That ought to be enough running\nfor today.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nLooks like you had a good workout there, Etie!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nエーティエ\nOh, it's you. What are you doing here?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nI thought you might want these when you\nwere finished.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nエーティエ\nWhat's that you've got in the jar?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nHomemade pickles. They should really help\nyou recover after a tough workout!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nHere, try one.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nエーティエ\nSure, why not? Thank you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nエーティエ\nOh! This isn't bad. It's got just the right\namount of tartness that I like.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nI'm glad I got it right.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nI know you're serious about your body, so I was\ncareful to keep them delicious but healthy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nエーティエ\nReally? You did that just for me?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nYep! And that's not all.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nI also slept with them under my pillow. Kind of\nlike how hens take care of their eggs.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nエーティエ\nNo kidding? That's...weirdly charming. You're a\ngood one, Clanne.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nYou can keep the whole jar. If you ever want\nmore, just let me know!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nエーティエ\nOh, I will. Thanks for brightening up my day!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06クラン\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nエーティエ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nエーティエ\nThere you are, Clanne.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nWere you looking for me? Are you out of\npickles already?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nエーティエ\nI'm ashamed to say this, but yes.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nThat was pretty fast.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nBut I noticed you've been training hard, so I\nsuspected they might not last that long.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nエーティエ\nI'm impressed. Not much gets by you, huh?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nHeh heh, it's nothing much. I just like to do\nwhat I can for our hardworking soldiers.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nエーティエ\nThose pickles were something else. I used to\nstay sore for a while after a workout.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nエーティエ\nBut ever since I started eating those pickles of\nyours, it hasn't been as much of a problem.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nエーティエ\nPlus, the taste is amazing. I couldn't keep my\nhands out of that jar.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nReally?! You don't know how happy I am to\nhear that! I'll gladly make you another batch.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nエーティエ\nYou don't mind, do you? I'd appreciate it!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nOh, are there any vegetables in particular you\nwant me to pickle?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nIt can be whatever you like─you can make\npickles out of pretty much anything.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nエーティエ\nUm...I'm drawing a blank right now. Is it OK if\nI leave it up to you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nエーティエ\nYou do seem to have been paying close\nattention to my preferences, after all.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nHaha, I suppose I have. Don't worry, I'll pick\nout the perfect vegetables for you!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nエーティエ\nI know you will.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06クラン\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nエーティエ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nHi, Etie. Your new batch of pickles is ready.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nI used a mix of three vegetables this time.\nThe thing is...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nエーティエ\nIs something wrong with them?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nThey didn't end up tasting very good. I'm really\nsorry. I shouldn't give you these.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nI thought the mix would work out, but it didn't.\nI'll probably have to start again from scratch.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nエーティエ\nHey. Clanne, don't worry about it. The taste\nisn't going to be a problem for me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nHuh? Why not?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nエーティエ\nI loved the taste of the pickles you made, but I\nloved the care you put into them even more.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nエーティエ\nYou didn't make just any old pickles─you knew\nthey were for me before you even started.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nエーティエ\nAnd it's clear that you put a lot of thought into\nhow I'd like them.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nエーティエ\nYour pickles do more than ease the strain on\nmy muscles.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nエーティエ\nThose good, good pickles soothe my soul too.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nエーティエ\nSo, don't worry about the taste. I'll be happy to\neat them anyway.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nEtie... That's really nice.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nエーティエ\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nUm... Was that your stomach?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nエーティエ\nYou heard that, did you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nSo when you said the taste wasn't a problem\njust now, were you speaking from the heart...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nor were you speaking from the gut?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nエーティエ\nI meant every word! Sheesh. Don't make me\ntake it all back.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nOh, isn't it almost time for your workout?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nエーティエ\nYeah, it is. Can I have a few pickles before I go?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06クラン\nDon't say I didn't warn you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nエーティエ\nClanne, come on. I told you that doesn't matter,\nand I meant it. Now let me taste the love!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
