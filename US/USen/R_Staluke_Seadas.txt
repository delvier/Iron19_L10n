MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nスタルーク\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08セアダス\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nスタルーク\nSeadall? May I ask you about something?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nWhat would you like to know, Prince Alcryst?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nスタルーク\nI've heard that you were once part of a\ntraveling caravan.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nスタルーク\nIs that true?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nYes. That's right.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nMerchants, performers, dancers... I've traveled\nwith them all and many more.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nスタルーク\nReally?! That must have been incredible!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\n"Incredible"? That's a flattering description.\nI'm surprised you think so.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nスタルーク\nWell, I've rarely traveled outside of Brodia.\nMy duties as a prince keep me so busy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI see.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nスタルーク\nI'm also a bit of an introvert... I envy those who\ncan navigate foreign cultures with ease.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nThe world is full of wonders. The things I've\nseen...some of it would take your breath away.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nIn fact, if you're truly interested in that life,\nI could tell you a story or three.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nスタルーク\nReally? I would enjoy that very much!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nOf course, if I tell you these tales, I will be\nobliged to leave out some of the best bits.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI can't be responsible for inspiring a prince to\ngo adventuring beyond his kingdom's walls.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nスタルーク\nOh, no need to worry. I'm not that brave. I was\nanxious just asking you a simple question.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nスタルーク\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08セアダス\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nスタルーク\nThat's amazing! Wolf jousting sounds like a\nthrilling sport to witness.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nThat it is.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nBut it's the fights out in the crowd...hm, that's\nwhere you'll find the real action.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nThere are plenty of ways to amuse oneself in\nSolm, but nothing is quite like the Wolf Arena.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nスタルーク\nSo many stories... What a fascinating life you've\nled, Seadall.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nスタルーク\nYour descriptions are so vivid. I feel as if I've\nwitnessed it all with my own eyes!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nスタルーク\nThe caravan lifestyle sounds like so much fun.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nスタルーク\nComing and going as you please, following your\nown whims and curiosities all over the world.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nスタルーク\nNo restrictions, no cares...and if you ever grow\nbored, you can just set off on another journey.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nスタルーク\nI wish I could have that life...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nYes, well...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nスタルーク\nThere's one story you haven't told yet. When\ndid you first join the caravan?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nスタルーク\nI bet you were born into it. Am I close?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nNo. I was born in a town by the sea.\nIt was...beautiful.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI was so young when my father died, I have no\nmemories of him. My mother raised me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nShe was a fortune-teller, but...an ill-fated one.\nShe got sick and died when I was young.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nOne thing led to another... Before long, I was\nliving on the streets.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nスタルーク\nOn the streets? But why?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI was a child without a family. Where else\nwould I live?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nスタルーク\nOh...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nBut one day a caravan was passing by. The\ntravelers called to me...invited me to join them.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nAnd I did. I traveled with them from that day on.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nSpeaking was difficult for me then. Words were\nhard. So my teacher taught me to dance. \x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI learned that I didn't need words to\ncommunicate. That saved me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nスタルーク\nI see...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nAh, my apologies. That story is not so amusing\nas the others...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nスタルーク\nPlease, I'm the one who should apologize.\nI didn't think before broaching the subject.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#028	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nNo, I've darkened the mood.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#029	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nI'm sorry. I think this is a good place to stop\nfor now. Another time, Prince Alcryst.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nスタルーク\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08セアダス\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nスタルーク\nSeadall? I'd like to apologize once more for our\nconversation the other day.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nスタルーク\nI really should have considered your feelings\nbefore asking about your past...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nIt didn't bother me, and you didn't do\nanything wrong.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nスタルーク\nI've been thinking about your stories since then.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nスタルーク\nI had assumed the caravan lifestyle was all fun\nand games...but that's not true, is it?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nNo. Fun isn't the right word.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nThat life can be brutal beyond compare.\nI watched friends die during raids...and worse.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nスタルーク\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nスタルーク\nThere must have been so many hardships...and\nyet, I assumed it was a life of leisure.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nスタルーク\nIf I had looked past my own desires for even a\nmoment before speaking... I really am sorry.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nOh, Prince Alcryst...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nLike I said, you've done nothing wrong.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nYes, bad things happened when I was traveling\nwith the caravan.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nBut good things happened too. Many more\ngood things.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nThe caravan was my family and my home.\nI count myself lucky to have lived that life.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nスタルーク\nI'm very glad to hear that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nSo please, do not hesitate. Ask as many\nquestions as you like.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nAsk me about the strange and wonderful foods\nI tasted for the first time at the border village.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nOr about the morning sun I watched set the sky\non fire as it rose over the desert oasis. \x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nThere are so many questions I hope you ask.\nAnd so many stories I hope to tell you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nスタルーク\nYour tales mesmerize me, Seadall. I can't wait\nto get lost in them again.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nスタルーク\nPlease, tell me a new one─and another after\nthat! Tell me stories until the break of dawn.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08セアダス\nHaha... With pleasure, Prince Alcryst.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
