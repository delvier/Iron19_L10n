MID_WU_C_1_IN_#001	Guh, I'm so nervous about this...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#001	Ah! You're awake!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#002	Now I'm just intruding on sacred ground!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#001	So this is a sacred altar, huh?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#002	Wow. Everything in here looks so expensive...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#003	Such luxury! I could just die...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#001	Good morning! Phew.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#002	I'll just, uh, get out of here...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#001	Sleep is the best... You're not hungry while\nyou sleep.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#001	Good morning?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#002	It was my job to wake you today.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#003	So...I'll be going now!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#001	No pillows? This doesn't look very comfy...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#002	I think I'd manage, but...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#003	I should make something soft.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#001	Ah! Sorry!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#002	I came to wake you, but I'm gabbing\nabout pillows...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#003	Good morning, I guess!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#001	Oh no! I got here early!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#001	Sorry, I'm early...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#002	You can go back to sleep, OK?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#001	I'll craft something while I wait.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#002	Let's connect these bits of wood...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#003	Set the stone, hammer it in, dab of paint...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#001	Morning!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#002	I made you an alarm clock, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#003	Set a time, and it'll explode into bits of─\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#004	Huh? You don't want it?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#001	Ngh... I wish liquids weren't so...ugh, awkward\nto carry!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#001	Good morning!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#002	Care for some milk diluted with water?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#001	I'm glad we did that training together.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#002	You liked your pack too...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#003	Hmm... What should I make for you next?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#001	Morning! Care for some milk diluted with water?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#002	The milk lasts longer, and it still tastes\npretty good!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#001	Time to wake up.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#001	A nice, quick wake-up.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#002	Good thing. Now I can leave this fancy room a\nbit sooner.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#001	If I close my eyes halfway...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#002	all of this fancy decorating might intimidate me\na bit less...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#003	Wait... Augh! This won't work! Now I'm just\nnervous that I'll knock something over!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#001	Morning, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#002	This room always gets to me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#003	I have to get over this feeling...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#001	Haah... Haah... I can't believe I lost track of time\ndigging up Brodian yams!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#001	Oh! You're up!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#002	I'll cook up a yam feast to apologize for\nbeing late, OK?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#001	It wasn't even the yams.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#002	It was all that edible wild grass!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#003	I just couldn't stop picking the stuff!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#001	Sorry, Divine One! I'm a little late.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#002	Huh?! This─ This grass?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#003	It's, uh, for crafting!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#001	It's me, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#002	I'm not nervous this time.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#001	Morning! Glad you got up fast...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#002	It is fun to wake you, though.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#003	For your sake, I'd have kept trying.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#001	I wore the Pact Ring.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#002	It gets dirty when I work...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#003	and I'm scared to lose it in battle...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#004	I never know when to wear it, but...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#005	If I don't wear it in here, with you...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#006	when would I ever, y'know?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#001	Morning. Could we, uh...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#002	Could we linger here for just a minute?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#003	I treasure these quiet moments...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#004	They're so rare.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#001	Your most trusted partner is here! Hehe!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#001	Did you hear that?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#002	I just wanted to try the phrase on for size!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#003	I will admit, putting it into words makes me kind\nof embarrassed...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#001	I brought some minerals with me!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#002	Which color do you like?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#003	I kind of like this peach-colored one.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#004	I can inlay a stone...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#005	and make a new ring for you!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#006	I want this to be my best work. Then it will fully\ncapture how I feel.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#001	You're up!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#002	See how pretty these are?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#003	One wasn't enough. I needed all of them...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#004	to really show how much you mean to me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
