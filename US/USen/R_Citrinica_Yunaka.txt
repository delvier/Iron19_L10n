MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nシトリニカ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ユナカ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nYunaka. Tell me what you have planned for the\nupcoming Brodian assembly.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nSorry, could you try again? Only one of my ears\nwas ready that time.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nI know you've been asking around for details on\nthe upcoming gathering of Brodian officials.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nUh...what?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nBrodia is my treasure, as are its people. If you\nhave any criminal intentions, I will stop you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, hold up. Back it up. I-I think\nthis might be a misunderstanding.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nOh? What exactly am I "misunderstanding"?\nYou are lying about your identity, are you not?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nThat's, uh... Well, I...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nDon't bother denying it. You've fooled many,\nbut I know your true profession.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nYou're an assassin.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nI assume you didn't consider someone like me\nto be a threat.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nAs a noble it's my duty to keep my people safe,\nand I can tell that you're up to something.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nI've already gathered all the evidence I need. If\nyou don't confess, I'll tell everyone about you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nYeah. It's true. I was a Brodian assassin.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nHonestly, though, I've put that life behind me.\nThat's not who I am anymore.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nTry harder.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nI'm telling you the truth. Look, hear me out\nat least. Please─I'll tell you everything.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nFine. I'll hear what you have to say...but later.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nKnow this, Yunaka...to protect Brodia, I can and\nwill act with a heart of cold steel. No mercy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nYeah. I'll remember.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nシトリニカ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ユナカ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nAll right, Yunaka. I'll listen to what you have to\nsay, but if a single lie slips through your lips...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nI'll start from the beginning. And I won't lie.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nThe girl in this story isn't named Yunaka.\nShe's called Larimar.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nShe's born to a poor family living in a town on\nthe Brodian bluffs. Her parents abandon her.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nShe isn't even old enough to understand why.\nBut then a man takes her in...an assassin.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nOh!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nHe tells her he wants a little helper.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nSo he trains the girl to kill.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nTo what end?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nEasy money.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nSo this man foisted his profession onto you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nCorrect.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nAnd that's how you became an assassin...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nThere is tragedy to your tale, but you've earned\nno sympathy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nI'm not asking for sympathy. And I'm not done.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nFine. Continue your story.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nWait─someone's coming.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nIs that a problem?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nWe'll have to finish this another time.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nVery well.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nシトリニカ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06ユナカ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nAll right, Yunaka. We're alone. Finish your story.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nAll right.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nThe girl does as she's told─as she's trained to\ndo. Killing is just a job to her. Not personal.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nUntil one day, when the assassin who raised her\nfalls ill.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nHis disease is incurable. He has little time left.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nSo he tells the girl the real reason he took her in\nwas to set her up to succeed him.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nAnd then, offering all the money they'd earned\ntogether as payment, he gives her one last job.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nNo...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nShe feels mostly scorn for him. But she also\nknows that, without him, she wouldn't be alive.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nSo she honors his last wish. She puts him down.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nAfter that, Larimar gives up murder for hire.\nTries to move on with her life.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nShe changes her name to Yunaka, and that's it.\nHere she is. Being someone new.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nI see...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nNow, about the meeting with the Brodian brass.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nRight. I'm still suspicious of your intentions.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nI was laying the groundwork for a project.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nWhat kind of project?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nTruth is, I've been wanting to set up a fund to\nhelp underprivileged kids.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nThat meeting was going to be the start. I was\nplanning to propose the idea there.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nOh!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nSo that's why you've been asking so many\npeople about the Brodian assembly.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nExactly. My goal is to do all I can to make sure\nno kid has to go through what I went through.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nI've been a vicious fool.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nWhat? No way. You were right to be suspicious.\nThat didn't bug me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nYunaka, please allow me to help you establish\nthat fund. Consider it the start of my apology.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nWait, really?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nAs this war rages on, the number of children\nwho have lost parents grows and grows.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nBrodia's heart is breaking. Many of our nobles\nhave been searching for ways to help.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nPlease, let me share my connections. I acted in\nbad faith...and I must atone for that mistake.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#032	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nNo, no! You've got nothing to atone for.\nSeriously, I'm nothing but grateful.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#033	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nI'm relieved to hear that...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#034	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nYou're trying to do a wonderful thing here.\nI will ensure that you find success.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#035	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nシトリニカ\nYou and I have a long working relationship\nahead of us. I look forward to it!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#036	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06ユナカ\nYeah, we do! And I promise you, I'll never\nforget this kindness.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
