MID_WU_C_1_IN_#001	I was surprised to learn...
MID_WU_C_1_IN_#002	of this duty to wake the Divine Dragon.
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#001	If you rose quickly more often...
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#002	it would save your allies time.
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#003	No matter.
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#004	Good morning.
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#001	Still asleep.
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#002	This may be a problem.
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#003	A leader prone to oversleeping...
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#004	could cause trouble for the little ones.
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#001	Awake at last.
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#002	Very good.
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#003	Now, get out of bed.
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#004	I will not allow you to go back to sleep.
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#001	Far more difficult than sending Emblems\nto slumber...
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#001	Thank you for rising quickly.
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#002	Now that my duty is done, I will take my leave.
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#001	Sound asleep.
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#002	Indeed, I wonder if you might rest forever...
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#003	if we left you unattended.
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#004	This must be how Rafal felt...
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#001	Good morning.
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#002	You have overslept a bit...
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#003	but there is time.
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#004	Still, best not delay.
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#001	It is time to wake.
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#002	Are you alive?
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#001	You seem to wake easily enough.
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#002	Perhaps you merely ask for help with this\nbecause you are lonely.
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#001	The wound you took to protect me appears to\nhave healed.
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#002	But you have sustained more injuries in the\ntime since.
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#003	I suppose that is to be expected.
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#004	Even so...
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#001	You are awake.
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#002	Whatever battles may await you today...
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#003	I hope you will look after yourself.
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#004	You did promise me that.
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#001	Honestly. I suppose you intend to sleep the\nentire day away.
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#001	You bolted awake.
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#002	You must be aware you overslept, then. Good.
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#003	Some might take exception, but I will not\nscold you for it.
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#001	Your other allies may wake you gently...
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#002	but I will not coddle you.
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#003	Now, get up.
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#004	Your enemies are not standing idle.
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#001	About time.
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#002	No, I am not angry.
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#003	If I seem so to you...
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#004	perhaps that is the guilt you feel\nfor oversleeping.
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#001	I wonder if my Divine Dragon...
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#002	ever needed assistance in waking up.
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#001	You overheard me.
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#002	The other Divine Dragon...
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#003	never asked for help with anything.
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#004	But I do not mean to complain. In truth, I enjoy\nbeing useful to you.
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#001	I may reminisce from time to time...
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#002	but it is not that Divine Dragon...
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#003	I seek to protect now.
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#004	Please, Divine One...stay out of harm's way.
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#001	I suppose you heard all that.
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#002	It should not be a surprise that I pray for\nyour safety.
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#003	As we have said...
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#004	neither of us wishes to lose the other.
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#001	If this keeps up...
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#002	I may have to start calling you the Divine Dozer.
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#001	Hm-hm.
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#002	As I thought...
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#003	the shock of your new title was enough to\nwake you up.
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#004	Good morning, Divine Dozer.
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#001	Frankly, I am amazed.
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#002	You slept right through my saying that.
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#003	I may need to commit to calling you a\nsilly name...
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#004	until you get the message.
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#001	Finally awake.
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#002	Hm?
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#003	You had a dream in which someone was using\na strange title for you.
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#004	I do not understand.
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#005	You seem to be talking nonsense.
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#001	Divine One.
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#002	Just because I love you...
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#003	does not mean I will go easy on you.
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#001	Good morning.
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#002	I am pleased you woke quickly.
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#003	That gives us time.
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#004	Let us spend this morning alone together,\nshall we?
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#005	Just us, my love.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#001	You are as stubborn as ever.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#002	But if I am honest...
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#003	I am reluctant to disturb you.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#004	I would just as soon lie next to you and\npeacefully drift away...
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#005	were it not for the fact that the world needs us\nmore than ever.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#006	So...
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#007	I must ask you to wake up.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#008	Not only for the sake of the world...
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#009	but for me, the one who loves you more\nthan anyone.
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#001	Hello, my love.
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#002	Let us do what we can for the world today.
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#003	And then...
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#004	when you come home...
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#005	safe and sound...
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#006	I will sing you to a peaceful sleep.
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#001	I am here a little early today.
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#002	Divine One?
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#003	Ah. Still asleep.
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#001	Sorry.
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#002	I did not mean to wake you.
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#003	But...
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#004	I am glad.
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#005	You seemed to sense my presence.
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#006	What do you say...
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#007	we spend the morning together?
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#001	It sometimes troubles me...
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#002	watching you sleep.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#003	Your expression so resembles that of the\nother Divine Dragon.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#004	The one I once knew.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#005	That final, peaceful stillness is etched forever\nin my mind.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#006	No matter what I do...
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#007	I cannot shake this feeling.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#008	I will always fret over you.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#009	So, please...never leave my side.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#010	I cannot bear the thought of parting ways\nwith you.
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#001	Awake at last.
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#002	I enjoy this time with you.
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#003	Even if it is every day...
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#004	I will never tire of us being together.
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#005	In fact, I can no longer imagine my life without\nyou in it.
