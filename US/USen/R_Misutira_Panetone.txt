MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nミスティラ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08パネトネ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nAh, that was just what I needed. It's been way\ntoo long since we rode together.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nYes, Boss. Nothing beats a nice jaunt\non wolfback.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nYou and I used to go riding practically every\nnight. What happened to those days?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nWar happened. The world has changed,\nunfortunately.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nIsn't that the truth. And you know, you've\nmellowed out a lot since those days.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nWhat do you mean by that?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nOh, come on! Remember how we met?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nYou had a bunch of bandits tied to trees and\nwere about to feed them to the wolves.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nThat was merely to intimidate them! I wasn't\nactually going to─\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nAnd don't get me started on the way you used\nto talk. You'd say things like...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\n"Feeling hungry, punks? I got a fresh serving of\nknuckles for you right here!"\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nWhy, I beg you to cease this coarse impression.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nHehe!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nDon't worry, Panette. I loved the old you, but\nI love the new you too.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nThe feeling is mutual, Boss. Your relentless\nteasing aside.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nミスティラ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08パネトネ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nBoss, when you said I had changed...you were\nright. I have.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nBut for that, I have you to blame.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nMe?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nYes. When we met, I was wild as they come.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nMy home life was...rocky, to say the least, and\nthat left me filled with anger.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nSo each day, I would go into town and pick\nfights with anyone who got on my nerves.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nLooking back on that time now, I see how\npointless it was.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nYet that was the only way I knew to cope...until\nI met you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nThough at first, of course, I assumed you were\nas wild as I was.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nHehe, we hit it off right away, huh?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nTaking out goons by day, riding our wolves\nby night...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nYes. We were thick as thieves.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nLittle by little, you helped point my rage in a\nmore...useful direction.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nAt men who cut you in line.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nThat only happened once. I was talking about\nall the bandits and thieves we fought.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nYou taught me to take all my pent-up,\ndirectionless anger and use it for good.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nWell, I'm glad. Though to be honest, that wasn't\nreally intentional.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nYes, I figured as much.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nEven so, if I had never met you...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nthat rage might have swallowed me whole and\nspit out a lonely, resentful husk.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nI could have wasted my life feeling bitter about\nthe hand I was dealt.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nミスティラ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08パネトネ\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nPanette, you said that without me, you would\nhave spent your whole life lonely and resentful.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nBut I don't think that's true.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nWhat makes you say that, Boss?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nWell, you were wild, sure. But your kindness\nalways shone through.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nEven when we fought the worst of the worst,\nyou didn't try to hurt them─just stop them.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nAnd after our long, late-night rides? You took\ntime to feed the wolves, brush their fur...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nThe truth is, I didn't swoop in and put you on\nthe right path. You were already there.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nDo you really think that?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nOf course. I knew you were a good person.\nThat's why I asked you to become my retainer.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nHuh, I remember that day. How surprised I was.\nI never suspected you were the princess.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nYou weren't convinced by the princess-like way\nI begged you? "Pretty please, be my retainer!"\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nIt just seemed absurd that a royal would want\nanything to do with a wild girl like me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nWell, I'm glad you agreed in the end. Thanks\nagain for that, Panette.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nBoss, please. It is I who should be thanking you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nOh, come on. You think I don't know how hard\nyou've worked?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nI know you were worried about embarrassing\nme or being rude to my family.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nThe rules of royal life are complicated and...and\narbitrary, sometimes, if we're being honest.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nBut you took time to study the proper speech\nand conduct of a retainer.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nIt was the least I could do to repay your\ngenerosity.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nPanette, I want you to know something.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nI will become a queen worthy of your efforts.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nミスティラ\nA queen you can feel proud to serve.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08パネトネ\nI have no doubt. And for my part, I shall\ncontinue to serve you with the utmost zeal.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
