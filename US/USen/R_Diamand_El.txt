MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x12\x0Cディアマンド\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0A\x04エル\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cディアマンド\nAmazing. What a remarkable novel.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nHello, little prince. All finished reading?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cディアマンド\nLady Nel. This is unexpected.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nIs it? I have been eager for an opportunity to\nspeak with you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cディアマンド\nWhat about?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nYou are no doubt aware that I am a child of the\nFell Dragon Sombron.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	Despite our differences in heritage, you are also\na child of royalty. We have this in common.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	I never understood my father. I thought perhaps\nyou could share some experiences with yours.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cディアマンド\nI've always wanted to be like my father, though\nthere were times I failed to understand him too.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	He's always been considered a great king for\nhis military might. That isn't how I'd like to rule.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nDifferent ideologies, then.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cディアマンド\nYou could say that. We occasionally butted\nheads over the future of Brodia.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nYet you were not sentenced to death for the\ndefiance of your lord father. Why?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cディアマンド\nWhat do you mean why?! We don't execute\npeople over simple disagreements in Brodia.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nI see. Unlike your father, Lord Sombron\npreferred to silence all dissent with execution.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	To object to his decree was out of the question.\nTo survive, there was no choice but to obey.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cディアマンド\nI can't even imagine living under such a vile\ndictatorship. I'm so sorry.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nThere is no need to apologize. That is all in the\npast for me now.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019	Hearing of your experiences has taught me a\ngreat deal. I hope we will speak again soon.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cディアマンド\nOf course.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x12\x0Cディアマンド\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0A\x04エル\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nWe meet again, little prince. Perhaps you will\nindulge me in conversation once more.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cディアマンド\nIt would be my pleasure.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nYour talk of Brodia piqued my interest. I wished\nto know more about your kingdom.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	So I took it upon myself to travel to the castle\ntown and gather information.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cディアマンド\nYou went all the way to Brodia Castle?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nFor a dragon, it is not far. Discretion was the\ngreater challenge, but I did go unnoticed.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cディアマンド\nI'll take your word for it. What did you learn?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nI heard much talk of the young Prince Diamant,\nwho will someday become a splendid king.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	There seemed to be little doubt that his reign\nwould be even greater than his father's.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cディアマンド\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nPerhaps it is strange for me to say, but it\npleased me very much to hear these things.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cディアマンド\nThank you, Lady Nel, but I really can't accept\nthe compliment.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nExplain.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cディアマンド\nIt's nice to hear I have a good reputation, but\nimagine for argument's sake that I don't.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	Suppose that all you heard in your time at the\ncastle was what a terrible king I'd make.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	If that was what everyone was saying, would\nyou accept the rumor without question?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nCertainly not. And I suppose you intend to say\nthat such rumors cannot be assumed true.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cディアマンド\nExactly. If you want to judge whether I'd be a\ngood king, you should do it with your own eyes.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nYou are right. It was careless of me to make\nsuch an assumption.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cディアマンド\nI know you were only trying to be nice. I hope\nI didn't offend.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nI took no offense. And what you said was\nprecisely correct.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	But since you suggested it, I have indeed\ndecided to take the measure of you myself.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023	So be advised─these eyes will judge whether\nyou have the makings of a worthy king.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cディアマンド\nHaha! I wouldn't have it any other way.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025	Until then, Lady Nel, I will be sure to put my\nbest foot forward.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x12\x0Cディアマンド\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0A\x04エル\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cディアマンド\nHello again, Lady Nel.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nLittle prince. I have been observing you\ncarefully since last we spoke.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	And I have determined, based on what I have\nobserved, that you will make a fine king indeed.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cディアマンド\nI am honored.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nYou possess great strength, both of body and\nmind. Your will and resolve are indomitable.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	And you have the ability to remain objective,\neven when placed under terrible stress.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	That is my assessment. Your kingdom will\nprosper during your reign.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cディアマンド\nThat's very high praise. Thank you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nNo thanks are needed. I merely spoke my mind.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cディアマンド\nThen let me speak my mind as well. Your\nkindness, wisdom, and tenacity are humbling.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	I've seen you throw yourself against strong foes\nand impossible odds to keep your friends safe.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nI am a dragon. Our superior durability allows\nus such indulgences.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cディアマンド\nNot even the toughest dragon would step up to\nprotect others without kindness of heart.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nI suppose.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cディアマンド\nI've seen your compassion off the battlefield\nas well.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	You cherish all life. You even once replanted a\nroadside flower so it wouldn't be trampled.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nI see that you have studied me quite closely.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cディアマンド\nIt was only fair to return the favor.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	It's not easy being a Fell Dragon from another\nworld, but somehow you make it look easy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x06\x04エル\nThank you for the compliment.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	I did not realize you had been assessing me.\nYou are even more interesting than I expected.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	Perhaps more observation is in order. You may\npossess more traits that I have yet to discover.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cディアマンド\nHm-hm! And you might retract some of that\npraise once you've dug up all my flaws.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	Until then, I'm happy to spend more time with\nyou. I think we'll make great friends.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
