MID_WU_C_1_IN_#001	It's Céline, Divine One. I hope I'm not intruding.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#001	Ah. You're awake.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#002	You rise with grace and dignity. I expected\nno less.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#001	Being here brings back memories.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#002	Mother used to bring Alfred and me here.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#003	You slept in just the same way back then. The\nonly difference is you did not wake.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#001	Apologies! You startled me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#002	I should not have been shocked to see you rise.\nYou do so every day now.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#003	In any case... Good morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#001	That was a longer walk than I thought. I hope\nthe tea hasn't gone cold.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#001	Good morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#002	I've brought tea to brighten your day.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#003	Shall we partake?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#001	You're a heavy sleeper.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#002	That's all right.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#003	I'll set the tea here so you can enjoy the aroma.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#004	These bright floral notes are bound to give you\npleasant dreams.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#001	Good, you're awake. The tea is still warm.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#002	Let's enjoy it together, shall we?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#003	It's one of my favorites.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#001	It still feels odd to come here on my own.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#001	Morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#002	Haha, your hair is rather a mess, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#003	I will go and fetch a comb for you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#001	Visiting you here has always carried...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#002	an air of solemnity.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#003	In the past, my family and I were always\nescorted in...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#004	by Queen Lumera.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#001	If you ever wish to talk, Divine One...\nabout anything...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#002	please know I would gladly lend you an ear.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#003	Haha, perhaps I shouldn't trouble you about\nit first thing in the morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#001	Ah, the Somniel...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#002	A stroll among such gorgeous flowers always\nput me at ease.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#001	I pray you can put aside your cares enough...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#002	to find joy in this serene and beautiful morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#001	I wonder if the Somniel has folktales...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#002	like those of the Firene royal palace.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#003	I could believe the enchanting scenery here was\nhome to a spirit or two.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#001	Good morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#002	I suppose all the folktales around here would be\nabout you, wouldn't they?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#003	Haha, that's quite a lovely...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#004	and uplifting thought.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#001	The most gorgeous flowers are in bloom this\nmorning, Divine One!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#001	Do you enjoy horticulture as much as I?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#002	I tend the lovelies down by the pond, you know.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#003	If you'd like to pay them a visit, I'd be happy to\nintroduce you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#001	I was going to bring you a blossom...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#002	but I could not bring myself to pick it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#003	Beauty is given such precious little time to\nthrive already.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#001	Good morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#002	What do you say to a walk before breakfast?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#003	I'd like to show you the place where these\nflowers are blooming.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#001	I greatly appreciate you lending me your ear\nas of late.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#001	I am proud to fight for my nation.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#002	But you fight for the entire world─and that is\nfar more pressure.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#003	If you ever need someone to talk to, I am here.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#001	After the bandits...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#002	I became concerned that I had grown weak.\nBut your words reassured me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#003	You said that what I felt was not weakness,\nbut kindness.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#004	Perhaps someday I'll believe that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#001	Good morning. Let us make ready for the\nday's battle.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#002	I am prepared to fight─both for Firene's peace\nand for you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#003	To that end, I will do whatever is necessary.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#001	I've come to wake you, my friend.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#001	Good morning. I've brought your favorite tea\nfor us to share.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#002	We've taken tea together so often by now...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#003	that I cannot do so anywhere without thinking\nof you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#001	Thank you again for the Pact Ring. Truly.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#002	Alfred was perhaps a touch surprised to hear\nabout it...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#003	but he's very glad that I have a friend who will\nsupport me no matter what.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#004	For me, it's a huge relief.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#005	I've come to rely on you ever so much.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#006	So I hope you will take good care of yourself\nthroughout this war.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#007	I do not think I could stand to lose you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#001	You wake gracefully...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#002	like a flower in bloom.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#003	And like the flowers here...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#004	I intend to protect and look after you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#001	I like coming here.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#002	It's more special to me now.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#001	No matter what happens...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#002	I know I'll find comfort...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#003	and support in your company.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#004	Armed with that knowledge, I can confidently\nsteel myself for any battlefield.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#001	Whatever battle brings...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#002	whatever choices I must make...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#003	I know now that I will always have someone\nwho stands by me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#004	That knowledge fills me with confidence like\nnever before.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#005	With you by my side, my friend...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#006	I feel as though I can withstand the most\nharrowing quandary.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#001	Hm.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#002	I have decided I will leave the Pact Ring here\nwhen we head out to battle.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#003	I'd like it to remain as pure and beautiful...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#004	as it is now─and as the friendship it represents.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
