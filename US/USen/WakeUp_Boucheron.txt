MID_WU_C_1_IN_#001	Divine One? Is it all right if I come in?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#001	Oh, you woke up fast.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#002	Guess I'll be on my way, then.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#001	Right, so... How do I do this?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#002	You're an important person, so I'd better be\npolite about it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#003	Divine One? Divine One...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#001	Phew.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#002	Good morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#003	Vander asked me to wake you up today, so\nthat's what I did.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#001	Haah... Haah...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#002	Finally made it...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#001	Morning!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#002	I got kind of turned around looking for\nthis place.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#001	Sorry I'm late.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#002	I knew it couldn't be far, but...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#003	I somehow ended up on the other side of\nthe Somniel.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#001	Morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#002	You may have overslept.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#003	I got a bit lost.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#001	It's Boucheron, Divine One. Hope I'm not\ndisturbing you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#001	Huh? You're already up?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#002	Are my footsteps really that loud?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#001	Ah, I just took a nice walk.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#002	The Somniel's huge, but the relaxing scenery's\nworth the hike.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#001	Hey, Divine One. What do you say we go for a\nmorning stroll?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#002	And, uh, you can lead the way!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#001	Wow, I found it quick this time!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#001	Look at me, waking you up on time today.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#002	Aren't you proud of me?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#001	Hey.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#002	Remember me getting lost...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#003	up in those mountains?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#004	Well I found my way here perfectly. First\ntry too!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#001	Morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#002	Everyone's waiting, so let's head over this way.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#003	What? That's the wrong way? It can't be... I was\nso sure...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#001	I brought something to make your sleep more\nrelaxing, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#001	Looks like you're already awake.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#002	I guess my idea can wait until next time.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#001	Pure mountain water.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#002	Listen to the sound.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#003	Soothing, isn't it? Peaceful.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#001	Good morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#002	Huh? You're going back to sleep already?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#003	Oh no, the water was too calming!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#001	Am I actually early today? Huh.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#001	Hello there.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#002	I was expecting to be late, so I decided to set\nout early.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#003	A little too early, as it happens. Oh well!\nI'm enjoying it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#001	I don't want to wake you too soon...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#002	so I'll read "Love in Bloom: The Lost Chapters."\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#003	Oh no... It's a tearjerker right from the start...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#001	...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#002	Oh, good morning, Divine One.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#003	Sorry, this book got me misty...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#001	Oh, thank goodness. I'm finally starting to learn\nmy way around.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#001	Good morning.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#002	Hahaha, are you concerned about me being\nable to escort you out?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#003	You've got nothing to worry about. I know the\nway just fine by now.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#001	Still...it's a strange feeling.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#002	Until recently, I was just an ordinary knight.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#003	Now, the Divine Dragon...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#004	Ah, just thinking about the Pact Ring has me\ngetting teary...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#005	You asked me to stay with you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#006	There's nowhere I'd rather be.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#001	There I go getting misty again. Sorry about that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#002	I just can't seem to stop the waterworks when\nI'm around you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#003	I'm too happy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#001	How about a stroll through the forest,\nDivine One?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#002	Oh, you're still asleep.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#001	Oh, haha! You woke up fast!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#002	Not to brag, but...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#003	I wonder if that's because I came to see you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#001	I still feel bad about waking you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#002	You're safe and sound in your dreams, far away\nfrom the war.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#003	I can cry enough for the both of us, so...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#004	stay there a while longer.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#005	Don't worry about a thing. I'll always be here\nto protect you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#001	Hey.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#002	Let's forget our troubles and go somewhere\nnice today.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#003	Anywhere you want. You know I'm always\nready to follow you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
