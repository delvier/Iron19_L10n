MID_RELIANCE_C_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06モーヴ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x12\x0Cセレスティア\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nCan I speak with you for a minute?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nWhat do you need?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nNothing per se. I just thought it might be nice\nto chat a little.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	Your voice and mannerisms... They remind me\nso much of the Mauvier that I knew.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nWhy are you crying?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI'm sorry. I just... I really wanted to apologize...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nWhat for?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nFor letting you die! You were like family to me!\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	If only I had pushed myself a little harder back\nthen. If only I hadn't left you alone!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\n...\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	Look at me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nYes...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nI cannot accept your apology.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nOh...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nI am not the aggrieved party. The words have\nno meaning to me.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017	I may have the same face as your former ally,\nbut we are not the same person.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nYou're right. I apologize for acting foolishly.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019	You're just so much like him. It's hard not to\nfeel as though he's back.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nI will admit to experiencing similar thoughts\nwhen we first met.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nYour name is also Mauvier, is it not?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nYes.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI imagine you already know, but I'm Zelestia.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#024	If it's all right with you, I'd like for us to\nbe friends.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nVery well, Zelestia. I look forward to working\nwith you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nLikewise, Mauvier.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06モーヴ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x12\x0Cセレスティア\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nAre you on break as well? Do you mind if I\njoin you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nBy all means.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nThank you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nYou are staring at me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI apologize. It's just so wonderful to be able to\nspend time with you like this.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nHm... Is it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nDon't worry. I'm not confusing you for the\nMauvier I knew before.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	It's just...really nice to spend time with a\nnew friend.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nI see. Even so, I will admit to some curiosity.\nWhat was my analogue like?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nThe Mauvier I knew was the one who started\nthe Four Winds.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	He was a stickler at times, but he was kind and\nstrong. A remarkable second-in-command.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nHe was in a position of authority, then?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nYes. As founder, he could have made himself\nthe leader, but he insisted that I take that role.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	Although, there were times he took charge, like\nwhen I would forget to eat regular meals.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	He would sometimes scold me too! "Sit down\nand eat properly!" Hm-hm!\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nIt seems you had a good relationship.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	If only I could say the same.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nOh?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nNo matter. Thank you for indulging me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nDo you know my counterpart from this world\nvery well?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nNot very well, but I do know her.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI'd like to hear about her sometime.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nIf you insist.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0C\x06モーヴ\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x12\x0Cセレスティア\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nDo you remember my request? I wanted to hear\nabout my counterpart from this world.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nI suppose I did agree to that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nYou look uncomfortable. Is this an awkward\ntopic for you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nNo, but bear in mind that much of what I am\nabout to tell you does amount to hearsay.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nOf course.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nIn this world, we formed a group that came to\nbe known as the Four Hounds.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	The group's purpose was to enact the will of\nSombron. Your counterpart was its leader.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nSo then, were you the second-in-command in\nthis world?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nThat role was filled by a different man.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	Zephia, the Four Hounds' leader, claimed to\nthink of us as a family.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nClaimed to?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nHer actions did not match her words. She was\nharsh, destructive, but above all, lonely.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	I have heard that her draconic instincts were\nabnormally powerful, even for a Mage Dragon.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	It is said that her home village was destroyed by\nan uncontrolled surge of her magic.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	Some go so far as to say that if Sombron was\nnot the Fell Dragon, then she would be.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nNo, that couldn't possibly...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nWhat I do know is that she relentlessly sought\nSombron's affection, pushing all others away.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	The Four Hounds were always at arm's length\nfrom one another. Personally, I never minded.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	But perhaps it is because we were not a true\nfamily that we went so very wrong.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI see...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nNot a pleasant tale, I know.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nMauvier, I... I don't think we should aspire to be\nfriends after all.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nIt seems I have offended you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nNot at all. I think I would like for us to become\nmore like family, as we were in my world.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nWould you? Why?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nI suppose I want to make sure you don't feel\ncompelled to go down the wrong path this time.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027	I know we're strangers now, but building strong\nbonds can help make you feel like you belong.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nThis is indeed rather sudden.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nThe heart is drawn to those who need it most.\nYou really don't understand this, do you?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nPerhaps I do not.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031	But if we are aspiring toward a familial bond,\nI suppose I can make an effort to try.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#032	\x0E\x03\x02\x0E\x0Cセレスティア\nHaha. Thank you, Mauvier.\x0E\x04\x02\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#033	Let's agree to support each other. I'm excited\nto get to know you better as a family.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#034	\x0E\x03\x02\x08\x06モーヴ\nI look forward to it as well, Zelestia.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
