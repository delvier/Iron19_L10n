MID_RELIANCE_C_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nNo problem. Always a pleasure to find an\nopponent who can help me work up a sweat.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nGlad to hear it, since I barely kept up. I see now\nwhy Brodia holds you in such high regard.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nDon't be too modest. You're good, and you've\ngot lots of room to grow.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nStrength, skill, speed... You're full of potential.\nKeep training─you'll see.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nMaybe, but what I really envy is your intensity.\nThe way you press the attack...it's relentless.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nDo you think I've got the potential to be as\nferocious a fighter as you are?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nThat's...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nSaphir?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nAh, sorry.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nListen... You'd be better off not modeling your\nfighting style too much after mine.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nFerocity doesn't suit you. You're too kind\na person for it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nJust be yourself, and hang on tight to that\nkindness. Don't let it go.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI understand, Saphir. Thank you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nザフィーア\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nOK, that's enough sparring for today.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThanks again for indulging me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nThere really is such kindness in your eyes, even\nwhen you're fighting. It's refreshing.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nAnyway, thanks for the warm-up. I'm off to do\nsome strength training.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nOne training session straight to another?\nYour stamina's amazing.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nWhen training is all you have, you give it all\nyou've got.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWhat do you mean, "training is all you have"?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nYeah, OK. I don't usually talk about this, but\nyou deserve an answer.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nI've always been strong, even as a kid. But back\nin those days, I had a friend I could never beat.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nThis friend trained hard─and I mean hard─with\nthe goal of becoming the strongest knight ever.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nOne day, Elusia attacked my village. My friend\nwas killed.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nAfter that, I figured someone should honor her\nwish to be the strongest. Might as well be me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'm so sorry for your loss.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI can't help but feel that isn't the only reason\nyou train so hard, though.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nWhat makes you say that?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThat ferocity when you fight...it doesn't feel\nlike grief to me. It feels more like vengeance.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\n...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nI really should get back to training. Muscles'll\ntighten up if I stand around too long.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nThanks for letting me talk your ear off, though.\nI'll see you later.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nSaphir...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI went too far. I should apologize...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nザフィーア\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nDivine One... I'm sorry for how I reacted\nto what you said about the way I fight.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nPlease, don't apologize. It was insensitive\nof me to pry.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nYou weren't wrong. I'm still holding on to\nhatred of Elusia.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nBut being the only one who lived...somehow\nthat's even more unforgivable.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nIf my friend had survived the attack instead of\nme, Brodia's knights would be stronger for it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nI think that's why I go all out in every battle.\nTrying to make up for the loss.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThank you for confiding in me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHearing it actually makes me feel a lot better.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nHow do you mean?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIf you trained so hard purely for revenge,\nI'd have to try to talk you out of it.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nEven if it leads to strength, that path is too full\nof grief to follow.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nBut now I see that you push yourself to fulfill\nthe wish of someone you care about.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI'm sure your friend appreciates it, but I still\ndon't think it's worth the pain you're carrying.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIf I were her...I'd just want you to be happy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nYou know...I never even considered that.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nMaybe you're right. We are talking about\none of the kindest people I've ever met.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nBut how can you be so sure what she'd think\nin this situation, Divine One?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIt's easy to know that sort of thing when you\ncare about a person.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nAh...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nWas that the wrong answer?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nNo, of course not. It's...nice to hear.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nThank you, Divine One. It means a lot to me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001	\x0E\x02\x02\x00\n\x0E\x03\x00\x0E\x08リュール\x021\n\x0E\x03\x00\x10\nザフィーア\x022\n\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHyah!
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nHah, nice one. I yield.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThanks for the match.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThat's enough training for today, though.\nPhew, you really wore me out.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nYou gave it your all today, Divine One. That was\nsome intense stuff.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nI know I said you had potential, but even I didn't\nexpect you to develop so quickly.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nIf I have, it's thanks to you─and not just\nyour encouragement.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI want to be strong enough to protect you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nProtect me?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHaha, I'm not sure I've ever seen you\nblush before.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nNo one's ever said anything like that to me\nbefore. I have no idea how to respond.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nHowever ferocious you might be, you still\nhave a tender heart.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI love that about you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nThat's why I want you to have the Pact Ring.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nUh...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nYou're the person I care for most. This ring\nis a symbol of how precious you are to me.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nSo, what do you say? Sparring partners forever?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nI...\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nCan I really let myself be so...happy?\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nI know it might seem impossible. You've been\nthrough so much pain and struggle.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nBut that's exactly why you deserve to have\nsome happiness.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nYou're right, \x0E\x06\x03\x00. Thank you.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nI'll take this ring and your offer happily.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024	\x0E\x03\x02\x0A\x08リュール\nGood, because I'm going to be there for you\nfrom now until the end.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025	\x0E\x03\x02\x0C\nザフィーア\nThat goes both ways. I'll fight with all I have\nto protect you...and to make you happy.\x0E\x04\x00\x00
